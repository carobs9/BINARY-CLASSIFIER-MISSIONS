We saw our colleagues rise to the challenges of an unprecedented global pandemic, show courage in the face of adversity, and make selfless sacrifices to heal the sick and protect our communities. These people are heroes. They are the front line workers who provided direct patient care to those who became infected with coronavirus. They are also the people who worked behind the scenes to ensure our staff had the personal protective equipment and telehealth technology they needed to continue to provide care safely. They are the support staff that cleaned and disinfected rooms, prepared meals, and countless other tasks to support our direct care workers. In this years annual report, we celebrate these heroes. They may not have flashy costumes or superpowers like the comic book heroes or those in Hollywood films. But like those heroes, they must don masks as they face a genuine and dangerous enemy. In the pages of this years annual report, you will learn more about who they are and what they do. We will take you behind their masks to discover the true identity of the heroes among us. Timothy J. Dentry, MBA President & CEO Kathy Corey Northern Light Health, Board Chair HEROES ON THE FRONT LINES When it comes to caring for sick patients, Northern Light Healths front line staff put themselves at risk to provide exceptional care. We know they are brave and compassionate people, but COVID-19 has shown how far they are willing to go to help others. The following are a few of the many examples of courage and caring that we witnessed during this global pandemic. Cathy Bean, RNManager of Clinical and Community Health Services Northern Light Home Care & Hospice In late March, Portland saw a spike in the population of homeless people who were getting sick with COVID-19. To help protect the citys homeless residents, city leaders immediately opened the Portland Expo as an alternative shelter site that would allow them to maintain their shelter capacity while adhering to the Centers for Disease Controls (CDC) social distancing guidelines. But how would they separate the healthy population from those with the virus? Cathy Bean, RN stepped up to help. Donning protective gear, she and her staff went into the shelters daily to screen and test the residents. Northern Light Home Care & Hospice also equipped the city of Portland with a telehealth system so home care nurses could provide follow up appointments. As a result, they were able to help shelter residents with other medical conditions that may have been missed. Many of these people, due to COVID-19, were in quarantine, and meals brought outside their door with no one able to check on them. Now, we could get in there and take care of these people, and thats been very rewarding. Cathy Bean, RNElizabeth Bigler, RN Emergency Department Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital Elizabeth Bigler, RN thinks the most significant change to her job since COVID-19 is how much more physically exhausting it has become. She must often wear respirators, hoods, and other personal protective equipment, which can get quite hot and stuffy during a shift in the Emergency Department. Her biggest concern is making sure she doesnt bring this virus into her home. Its why she enters through a basement door, places her clothing directly into the wash, and showers before interacting with her family. My daughter who is eight is a sensitive, insightful soul. And shes had a lot of fears about me getting sick, not being able to see me if I did get sick, or me not coming home. Her daughter wrote her a touching letter one morning, telling her to be safe and that she loved her. Shes a really strong little girl. I had to tell her that this is a community effort. I cant not go because its scary. Some people still need help, and our job as community members is to help them. Elizabeth Bigler, RNJames Jarvis, MDSenior Physician ExecutiveIncident Command, Northern Light Health When Northern Light Health knew COVID-19 would arrive in Maine, James Jarvis, MD was chosen to coordinate the systems response among its member hospitals in addition to coordinating with state and local governments and the other major healthcare systems in Maine. Another unexpected role that Dr. Jarvis fulfilled during the pandemic was to be the primary spokesperson for Northern Light Health for weekly statewide news conferences via Zoom. Several times a week he would convey critical information to members of the media and our communities. One of the pleasant surprises Ive had during this time was somebody randomly driving by, lowering their window, and saying, Dr. Jarvis, how are you doing? You always ask how were doing through TV, we want to make sure youre okay. I teared up a little because, sure its neat to be recognized, but it was that sense of community that Mainers have to say, we need to make sure youre okay because we appreciate what youre doing. James Jarvis, MDCaroline Joyce, PACNorthern Light Primary Care Northern Light CA Dean Hospital Caroline Joyce loves the outdoors and dreams of retiring in a small rural community where hiking, fishing, and camping abound. She and her husband built their retirement home in Greenville, and she took a job at Northern Light CA Dean Hospital in September of 2019. Little did she realize how good her timing was to move to a rural community before the outbreak of COVID-19. As a primary and acute care provider, she willingly staffed the drive-up screening tent outside CA Dean. She endured wind and rain and snow to screen patients. And, she did all this while her mother, living in a nursing home in another state, was diagnosed with COVID-19. Luckily, my mom experienced mild symptoms, and while I wanted to see her, she was in an area of Massachusetts that was really hit hard by the coronavirus, and I was here seeing patients. I couldnt risk exposing them or my family. Caroline Joyce, PACSue-Anne Hammond, DOMedical Director of Primary CareNorthern Light Mercy Hospital For Dr. Hammond, COVID-19 became personal very quickly as one of her long-time patients, with whom shed experienced many ups and downs, was among the first in Maine to die of the deadly coronavirus. It was a curve ball, and it felt so unfair, she said. Dr. Hammond was instrumental in setting up the COVID-19 response plan for Northern Light Mercy Hospital, which became a model shared with other Northern Light Health hospitals across the state. The drive-up swab and go tent at Mercys Fore River campus allowed people to safely and easily get tested for the coronavirus. The plan also included a respiratory tent site in Westbrook to assess whether people with symptoms needed to be admitted to the emergency department or sent home with care instructions. And it included a virtual clinic to keep patients out of hospital and primary care settings through telehealth for follow-up appointments. She worked seven days a week while her children were being schooled at home. She and her husband, also a front line provider, tried to allay their familys fears and correct misinformation in their communities. On the hardest days I still love what I do. I dont feel like Im a hero; Im doing what was asked of me and what I chose to do as a doctor. This is a hard time, but I dont think I want to be anywhere else in the middle of all of this. Sue-Anne Hammond, DOJodi Kierstead, RNNurse Manager, Specialty ICU Northern Light AR Gould Hospital As a nurse manager, Jodis Kiersteads world radically changed when COVID-19 showed up in Maine. She went from managing budgets and staff training to suddenly responding to a pandemic. She enjoyed watching her staff pull together. Youre taking a bunch of people out of their comfort zone and putting them through huge changes and for them to do it with a smile it was amazing! And Jodi did her part to help too. As Northern Light Mercy Hospital in Portland was becoming inundated with patients, they put out a call for additional staff to help. Not only did Jodi travel to Portland and support her colleagues, despite having a 10-month-old baby at home, she and her team assembled a care package for Mercy nurses. We look out for one another. Thats what nurses do. An Jenica Achey, CNA Northern Light Continuing Care, Lakewood Caring for elderly residents at Northern Light Continuing Care, Lakewood is an enormous responsibility that Jenica Achey understands all too well. She works with a vulnerable population, and is living with someone at high risk. Jenica, who rarely leaves her house except for work, canceled out of state travel plans to ensure her family and Lakewood residents are safe. For me, its the gratitude that they all show. You can see it in their faces when you put on their make-up or help them pick out an outfit. During COVID-19, as residents can only communicate with family through closed windows, by phone, or electronically, she says its more important than ever to show comfort and compassion. They cant see your smile with a mask over your face, but your eyes smile too. And they can see that. And that helps them. Jenica Achey, CNAShane Mack Mcpherson Psychiatric Technician Northern Light Acadia Hospital Mack Mcpherson says his co-workers are like his extended family, and they pulled together even more during the extraordinary challenges of running a psychiatric hospital during a global pandemic. Were in the business of working with people who are in some form of crisis, either medical needs or mental health needs. Its just what we do naturally. As a psych tech, Mack considers his job to do what needs to be done to support patients and clinicians. He says the only change for him during COVID-19 is that hes helping other staff with needs too. Hes cleaning, doing small repairs, getting batteries for a thermometer, whatever is needed. The most challenging part of the pandemic for Mack personally is not having face-to-face interactions with co-workers. Acadia is known for being able to recognize when somebody on the team is having a rough day or a rough couple of days. And, we are great at surprising them with their favorite candy or coffee, or writing a card. Shane Mack McphersonCassie CraigParamedic Northern Light Medical Transport Since the start of the pandemic, when a 911 call comes into Northern Light Medical Transport, the caller is screened to see if the patient has COVID-19 symptoms. That way, Cassie Craig knows if she must suit up in full gear, including respirator masks, goggles, gloves, and gowns. This adds some time to the response, but is an important step to protect her and her co-workers, to stop the spread of the virus, and to make sure she can continue her job. She also makes sure to wash her clothes at the station in order to limit any exposure to family members. I would come to work in a pandemic as I would come to work on a Tuesday, this is the job that I signed up for. Its become more difficult lately, but Im going to come to work anyway. Im here to do my job. Cassie CraigBrent Watson, RN, BSN, MLT, CEN, CFRNDirector of Nursing for Emergency Department / Laboratory Services As the director of the Emergency Department at Northern Light Mayo Hospital, Brent Watson spent long hours informing people of evolving CDC guidelines in the early stages of the COVID pandemic. He also spent considerable time traveling to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center to study how they were equipped to handle a potential influx of patients. Since Mayos emergency staff is relatively small, he cross-trained other Mayo nursing staff to work in the Emergency department. Personally, I wouldnt consider myself a hero in any aspect; this is something I signed up for. I am a professional nurse. I love taking care of people; I love taking care of the community in which I live. Brent Watson, RN, BSN, MLT, CEN, CFRNMatt GrantCardiopulmonary Respiratory TherapistNorthern Light Mayo Hospital Matt Grant is one of two full-time respiratory therapists at Northern Light Mayo. Understanding that COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, he knew his services would be in demand if there were an influx of patients. So, he also spent time training staff to make sure they were ready. Both Brent and Matt say its all part of the job, even in a global pandemic. People have been very appreciative, and Id be remiss not to acknowledge that, but I dont consider myself a hero. We havent been hit as hard as some hospitals across the country. They are working nonstop overtime and going out and being in the face of this. I would consider myself lucky, but I wouldnt consider myself a hero by any means. Matt GrantTiffany BennerClinical SupervisorNorthern Light Maine Coast Hospital As a supervisor, Tiffany Benner says the most challenging part of the pandemic was when she didnt have immediate answers for staff. Early on, there were many unknowns would they have enough personal protective equipment? How long would this last? Would there be staff reassignments? She learned to communicate what she knew when she knew it, which helped alleviate fears. She did have a very well laid out plan at home. Once the pandemic reached her county, she would not leave the house, except for work, and her newlywed husband would do the shopping. """"I dont think of myself as a hero. I didnt decide to become a nurse because I thought in 2020 there would be a worldwide pandemic, and it would look awesome when I leave work. I do my job because I like to help people. I like to help the community. Tiffany BennerTammy Violette, RNDirector, Physician PracticesNorthern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center In regular times, Tammy Violettes job involves supporting clinical services and staff of Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Centers Primary Care. But since COVID-19, she has also become an expert in swab and go sites screening and testing people for COVID-19. Tammy helped coordinate staff at the testing site, which was a partnership with the City of Bangor, EMMC, St. Joseph Hospital, and Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC). How was traffic going to flow? What type of staff were we going to use? How were the swabs going to get collected? How are they going to be housed? So, there was a lot of logistics in terms of details, she explains. Everyone in our community, our eyes have been opened to everyday heroes. Individuals that continue to keep the grocery store stocked so that people can eat during this time. I think that we all just have to remember that were in this together, and we should be thankful for the efforts of all. Tammy Violette, RNLisa Boutwell, PTAPhysical Therapist Assistant Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital Physical Therapy was a service that completely shut down at the start of the pandemic. Lisa Boutwell, PTA went from seeing patients in outpatient rehabilitation to staffing Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospitals drive-up site to screening and testing patients. As a runner, she took the test bag from providers administering the tests to the hospital or lab. Lisa is one of many healthcare staff members who stepped up to serve the community in all kinds of ways, in all kinds of weather. One day out in the testing tent, it was very windy, the walls were blowing in. We also had a snowstorm and large snow piles outside of the tent, but we made do, and our community was safer because of it. Lisa Boutwell, PTAA Leader to HeroesA good leader inspires people to have confidence in the leader; a great leader inspires people to have confidence in themselves. Eleanor Roosevelt A leader who empowers others to act decisively is precisely the type of leader a healthcare system needs during a global pandemic. As the coronavirus began forcing the state of Maine to shut down, Tim Dentry was settling in as president and CEO of Northern Light Health and facing an immediate crisis that would put his experience and leadership skills to the test. On March 24, I was offered the position. It was announced on March 25, and April 1 is when I began these responsibilities, Dentry explains. He had already been with Northern Light Health as chief operating officer for three years and was very familiar with the system. Also, he spent several years in Western Africa and the Middle East working to improve healthcare systems for Johns Hopkins University. During the Ebola outbreak, I was in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. The Ministry of Health advised us on a Thursday that this is a big issue, and they want us to be the chosen hospital for Ebola response, and by Sunday, we had our first patient, recalls Tim. That experience helped Tim when the first case of COVID-19 appeared in Maine. By the time the state had issued stay-at-home orders, Northern Light Health had already enacted its Incident Command team and its supply chain team had already started preparing for a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Information Systems and Operational Excellence teams worked to increase delivery of healthcare services through telehealth. Under Tims leadership, Northern Light Health also set up alternative care sites and COVID-19 screening sites. I spent a lot of my time doing what Im doing now, getting out and talking to staff, asking questions, Tim traveled to member hospitals across the state to gather insight and perspective. He visited the Intensive Care Unit at Northern Light Mercy Hospital to see staff caring for COVID-19 patients. It was an emotional moment. So inspiring to me. It gave me strength. When I went to Mercy and AR Gould, I could see the face behind the mask; the eyes behind the mask. I could see fear, and I felt that fear. I could also see determination, and I fed off of that. Tim says he adheres to a philosophy called servant leadership, which he learned early in his career while working in Catholic health systems. He says its an approach that demands humility, which is why he doesnt consider himself a hero. But Tim does believe the people he leads are heroes. Everybodys a hero who has a part to play in this, he says. We have a culture of quality and within that culture of quality is a culture of caring and within the culture of caring is a culture of caring for one another. I want people to know thats what were in the business of doing. HEROES BEHIND THE SCENES While Northern Light Health employs many direct care providers, there are many more working behind the scenes to support them. When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Maine, these people helped keep our front line workers and patients safe during an unprecedented public health crisis. These unsung heroes worked in such areas as supply chain, facilities management, information systems, incident command, and environmental services. Kathy Knight, RNDirector of Emergency PreparednessNorthern Light Health Whenever a natural disaster or emergency strikes, Northern Light Health is prepared, thanks in part to Kathy Knight and her teams work. It is their job to prepare, respond, and recover from emergencies. They hold training throughout the year, and know what to do in an emergency. One priority is activating an incident command structure, which streamlines communications between key decision-makers. For the first time in its history, Northern Light Health had a unified response involving all member organizations. The incident command team had to resolve several issues all at once, including a disruption of the supply chain for personal protective equipment, new work plans based on the latest CDC guidance, and an immediate ramp-up of our information systems to accommodate an increased demand for telehealth services. While there are lessons learned from every emergency, Kathy was pleased with everyones work throughout the system. I look at what we have accomplished from maximizing resources, developing a single coordinated response, delivering transparent, timely, accurate, and standardized communications to all employees, and meeting the challenges of COVID-19 head on by remaining flexible, open-minded and imaginative, and I am just amazed! Kathy Knight, RNPaula Dietrich Behavioral Health ProfessionalNorthern Light Acadia HospitalUnder normal circumstances, Paula would be assisting teachers at Northern Light Acadias Pediatric Day Treatment Program. But, when COVID-19 hit, that program was provided via teleconferencing, and Paulas services were not needed as much. I said, put me where you need me, so here is where I am. The here is the main entrance of the hospital. With a sign-in sheet, a list of questions, and a digital thermometer, her job is to screen visitors, patients, and staff. Like everything she does, Paula takes it to the next level. Ive decorated the entry with butterflies throughout, and I have a beautiful silk flower arrangement with roses and peonies. I love to play string quartet music. And, I try to be calm and welcoming and let people know that we care, explains Paula. I think of what I do as being a part of the team here, and I dont think Im any more heroic than anyone else who is here on staff. Im just doing a little part of what everyone else is doing during the day, and thats it. Paula DietrichDavid ValcikVice President, Information Systems Northern Light Health In mid-February David and the Information Systems (IS) team started testing scenarios if large numbers of employees had to work remotely. They also looked to ramp-up telehealth services. Luckily, they had already started to improve our telehealth and teleconferencing platforms. Northern Light Acadia Hospital had been using Zoom telepsychiatry. Dave and the IS team had to quickly figure out how to expand it to the rest of the system. Before COVID-19, in January, we did approximately 1,500 to 1,700 telehealth visits. By April, we ramped-up to about 34,000. The technology we put in place allowed us to provide care to our patients who could not come in, says Dave. It meant a lot of work in a short time to modify these systems. The IS team played a crucial role in allowing front line staff and support staff to continue working safely while providing exceptional care for patients. Dave, who is also a pilot of a single-engine plane, literally went above and beyond his duties and organized a three plane flyover of Northern Light Hospitals last spring to honor our employees. We do this for a reason, the same as anyone else in the organizationto take care of our patients. The frontline people need our assistance, and were proud to offer that. David Valcik Dani Reardon, CPT, CHWCWellness CoordinatorBeacon Health Dani Reardon leads a virtual fitness class for Northern Light Health employees from a bright and welcoming home gym in the finished basement of her home. They try to follow along as she calls out instructions. Music is playing in the background. We all know that physical activity helps manage stress, depression, and anxiety in addition to keeping your body well, so by offering these noon classes, they can take the class and feel better, explains Dani. I love that Im able to do this; a big part of who I am is helping others. I want people to be well. Im glad I am able to introduce different types of exercise and hopefully participants find a love for it and continue. Dani Reardon, CPT, CHWCCarla LeinoEnvironmental Services Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital Whenever a patient with COVID-19 is treated in the Emergency Department at Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital, they can take comfort in knowing that Carla Leino is on the job. Dressed from head to toe in personal protective equipment, she goes into patient rooms to clean once patients are discharged. She is armed with cleaning chemicals and wipes down every surface as she sanitizes the room from floor to ceiling. We make sure that the cleaning were doing is the best that it can be, not only to protect ourselves but anyone else that will go into the room. When the next patient is coming through the door, that room is ready for them, says Carla. I dont have a special prayer, but I talk to God every day when I leave my house, and I ask him for strength to carry-on and do what I have to do no matter how it makes me feel. Im doing this for the greater good. Im doing his work. It gets me through. Carla LeinoMark Noble Supply Specialist II, Materials Management Department Northern Light Inland Hospital Whenever you need supplies to do your job, Mark Noble is the man who gets you what you need. I dont want anybody to say I dont have what I need when I need it. Until this point, not one person has had to say that, he says with pride. Mark is hoping he can continue to keep that record. Still, having personal protective equipment (PPE) in stock has been challenging during a pandemic that caused a global shortage of PPE and disrupted the entire supply chain. Fortunately, Mark and his team could see the warning signs and took proactive measures to increase ordering and find alternative vendors. We always look out for one another. My whole job is to make sure our patients and employees are safe and they have the equipment they need to stay safe. I take pride in that. Mark NobleCOVID 19: A patients story Baballa Adam knew something was wrong when he couldnt get out of bed on a Thursday morning in early June. He just lay in bed in the top floor apartment of his home in Portlands Valley Street neighborhood. His wife, Saida, called for help to get him to the Emergency Department at Northern Light Mercy Hospital. Baballa would spend the next week in the hospital recovering from COVID-19. He says that he never had difficulty breathing but that he was exhausted. It was very, very scary. I felt like I might not get out of here, like I was going to die, recalls Baballa. Despite regaining his strength and returning home, Baballa did have some lingering effects that required follow-up care. So, Northern Light Home Care & Hospice helped set him up at home with some monitoring equipment to check his temperature and blood pressure. He was also introduced to Laura Webber, post-acute care manager, Northern Light Beacon Health. Laura explains, When I received the referral, he was in the hospital at Mercy, and I followed him daily to see what was going on. He was discharged to Home Care & Hospice with a coup",0,The summary focuses on healthcare activities and community support during the COVID-19 pandemic without mentioning religious concepts or faith-based motivations.

"Waterfall Arts 2017 Programs and Accomplishments -- 990 Narrative ReportWaterfall Arts experienced continued growth in 2017, carrying on the upward trend continuously since the organization began in 2000. We were able to tally over 7700 visitors in 2017 -- a 51% increase over the previous year -- but many more come through the building uncounted, especially on Fridays in May-October, when the Farmers Market meets in our yard. ORGANIZATION Building on last years internal organizational development, this year we launched the quiet phase of a $1.75M capital campaign to address energy efficiency, accessibility, user-friendliness and aesthetics. A campaign committee was established, fundraising consultant engaged, and Business Plan and Case Statements were distributed to potential funders. The solicitation process is ongoing. Operations continued apace. The previous years budget growth to accommodate a new position stabilized and maintained this year, with six employees (positions range from 25-35 hours/week): a Marketing and Development Manager, a Youth and Family Outreach Coordinator, an Office Manager, the Co-Directors: Director of Programming and Director of Finance and Operations, and our Facilities Manager oversees the care and maintenance of our 80-year-old community center, a former elementary school. Twenty-five volunteers tend the gallery, manage the studios, coordinate exhibits, fundraise, perform office and marketing duties, and organize some of the events. The 13 board members participate in five working committees, held an annual retreat, and continued preparing for a capital campaign to improve the building for accessibility, energy efficiency, and consumer fulfillment. EXHIBITIONS Over 3100 individual visits were made into the Clifford Gallery, while many more saw the art in the Corridor Gallery. Seasonal exterior exhibits continue: the popular Living Wall, a vertical garden installed on the south wall May-September, a joint project with local students; and the Willow Dome on the front lawn. We were also honored to display a number of large colorful metal sculpture by Bayside resident Jim Wolfe on the exterior of the building, starting in the fall of 2016, through April 2017. 2017 EXHIBITION DESCRIPTIONS In House Jan 27 - Feb 24 Corridor GalleryWork by the denizens of Waterfall Arts will grace the walls of the corridors -- people who make art in the building in their studios or our classrooms, who work and volunteer for WA, studio subscribers, and our teaching artists. Young Artists Gallery Takeover Mar 3 - April 1 Corridor and Clifford GalleriesAn annual open call exhibition that includes over 250 works by youth aged 4-18 from area public schools, alternative schools, homeschooling groups, and other young members of the community. Students in Bridge, the after school art club, assist in organizing the event and prepare the work, including their own, for exhibition. Home -- Open Call Show April 7 - May 12 Corridor and Clifford GalleriesExperienced and novice artists from all over are invited to submit work under the theme home, referencing the familiar, the safe places in our lives -- physical spaces, landscapes, bodies and buildings, places where we and other species grew up -- as well as refuges of the mind and heart, the mental and spiritual spaces in which we thrive. Seesaw: Anna Hepler and Karen Gelardi May 26 - July 21 Clifford Gallery, Corridor and Exterior WallFor more than a decade Maine artists Karen Gelardi and Anna Hepler have worked together, sharing an interest in textiles, and printmaking, and making work that crosses the boundaries between two and three-dimensions. Seesaw will highlight their rich and intertwined language of form, surface, and process with sculptures made from ceramic, fabric, paper, and images both sewn and printed. Now based at opposite ends of the Maine coastline, with Belfast as a perfect mid-point between their studios, this exhibition explores the parallel and overlapping evolution of their work. Interiors July 28 - September 15 Clifford GalleryThis show is a curated collection of works that focus on representations of domestic spaces. The owners presence is clearly felt, but the human form is not the central idea; the work shows the interior spaces we occupy, rather than us in them. Artists include Alison Rector, Louise Bourne, Gideon Bok, Sarah Swajkos, David Estey, Jessica Ives, and Heath Paley. Arrival: Work by and about New Mainers September 22 - November 17 Clifford GalleryThis exhibition showcases work by and about artists who have arrived here, make their home here, are the New Mainers, and bring traditions/identities that are from other cultures, other countries, and who are mostly non-white. Were challenging the notion of a Mainer, and also a New Mainer. They range from recent immigrants to long-time naturalized citizens, and their diverse journeys and arrival in Maine are defining factors in their lives and their art. Included will be portraits by Portland-based French artist Orson Horchler of recent immigrants, and works by Ali Asgar, Edwige Charlot, Asherah Cinnamon, Titi de Baccarat, Rosalba Brazeale, Damir Porobic, Sze Wing Wong, and others. Our Sense of Home September 22 November 17 Corridor GalleryMaine artist Susan Smith focuses on socially engaged projects, and she will coordinate a community-generated installation of mass produced house forms, which will be distributed throughout the area to local schools, colleges, homeless service centers, food banks, nursing homes and libraries. Participants will take the basic cardboard house form and create art pieces to craft their interpretation of home, with the option of providing accompanying text. Materials will be on site throughout the exhibition so visitors can add to the installation. Handmade: Annual Affordable Art Show and Sale December 1 23 Clifford GalleryOur curated, highly popular arts and craft extravaganza, we display new work from over 100 contemporary crafters and artists, perfect for gift giving and receiving. EVENTS A total of 38 public events took place, some in conjunction with exhibits such as artist talks, or hands-on art demo nights, and at least 10 were specifically all-ages events. Ten were in partnership with other area organizations, such as the Belfast Poetry Festival or the All Roads Music Festival. Several events -- the annual Glow Show and the opening of the annual Handmade holiday show sale -- drew well over 200 people each. Overall, 3444 people attended events throughout the year. ART EDUCATION Educational programming grew as well. We gave classes in clay, hot glass, painting, printmaking of various types, and more for all ages; 57 were offered by 24 different teachers, with an admirable 72% meeting enrollment minimums. Over 440 students of all ages participated, almost exactly the same as last year. The Youth and Family Outreach program remains very busy, attracting new young people and their families. The afterschool art program is 3 afternoons per week: Bridge, free for 6th graders (who have no art in the local school), low-cost Bridge Jr, for 4th and 5th graders; and pay-what-you-can Teen Art Studio, for grades 7-12. Students volunteer at the Art Tent, installed at public venues and festivals around town, as well as at our All Ages Art Happenings (AAAHs) such as the annual Glow Show, or the Big Draw. Art Together Mornings are held monthly on Saturdays for kids and their parents to make art side by side. Outreach efforts brought our staff to present workshops at outlying Waldo County towns, as well as brought two school groups here for field trips. Waterfall Arts continued to offer scholarships to enable people of all means to participate in our programs. A grant from United Mid-Coast Charities and the Norton Fund (managed by us) allowed 29 students to attend from all over the county. FACILITY The Youth Art Studio -- the Bridge Studio -- is on the first floor, giving them their own self-enclosed working classroom. This move made for much more visibility for this program, and allowed for better use/availability of the public rental spaces -- the Dance Annex and the Fall Out Shelter in the basement. The longstanding Life Drawing group is in the Dance Annex on Saturdays, and the dedicated public studios -- Print, Darkroom, and Ceramics -- were available and utilized by the public through subscriptions. Waterfall Arts offers longterm studio rentals to artists, musicians, and creative economy entrepreneurs. Rental income is 25% of our revenue. In 2017, we had 100% occupancy all year of the 16 long term studios. Short term, or one-time event, rentals are available to the public and space was used by many different groups including a weekly fiddlers group, martial arts, and dance instructors, workshops, music shows and performances, and educational events.",0,"The summary focuses on arts programming, community events, and educational activities without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"THE MRC CONTINUED ADMINISTERING ITS POST-2018 PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. THE MRC, AFTER A LENGTHY EVALUATION PROCESS PRIOR TO 2015, HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PERC FACILITY WILL NOT BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AFTER THE ABOVE MARKET POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN 2018. IN ORDER FOR THE MRC MISSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND AFFORDABLE MSW TO CONTINUE BEYOND 2018, IT BECAME NECESSARY TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT AN ALTERNATIVE DISPOSAL OPTION TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE MRC MEMBERSHIP BEYOND 2018. THE MRC HAS PROCEEDED WITH SPONSORSHIP OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FACILITY TO MANAGE MSW ORIGINATING IN ITS MEMBER MUNICIPALITIES AFTER THE EXISTING DISPOSAL AGREEMENTS EXPIRE EARLY IN 2018. TO THIS END, THE MRC HAS PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING IN 2015: SELECTED AS MOST ADVANTAGEOUS A DEVELOPER OF AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY, FIBERIGHT, INC. (FIBERIGHT), THAT WOULD OWN AND MANAGE DESIGN, PERMITTING, FINANCING, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE NEW FACILITY ON A SITE TO BE SECURED BY THE MRC. ENTERED INTO A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT DATED FEBRUARY 4, 2015, WITH FIBERIGHT REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FACILITY ON THE HAMPDEN SITE. WORKED WITH FIBERIGHT TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS TO THE MAINE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FOR AN AIR EMISSION LICENSE AND A SOLID WASTE PROCESSING FACILITY LICENSE FOR THE FACILITY BEING DEVELOPED AT THE HAMPDEN SITE. ENTERED INTO A WASTE DISPOSAL AGREEMENT WITH WASTE MANAGEMENT DISPOSAL SERVICES OF MAINE, INC. DBA CROSSROADS LANDFILL (CROSSROADS LANDFILL), DATED AUGUST 24, 2015, FOR DISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTE RESIDUALS FROM THE FIBERIGHT FACILITY, AS WELL AS MSW THAT THE FIBERIGHT FACILITY CANNOT ACCEPT FOR PROCESSING AFTER APRIL 1, 2018. NEGOTIATED A MASTER WASTE SUPPLY AGREEMENT AND A SITE LEASE WITH FIBERIGHT REGARDING DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE FACILITY AT THE HAMPDEN SITE BY APRIL 1, 2018; COMMITMENTS TO DELIVER MSW TO THE FACILITY AS OF APRIL 1, 2018 AND THEREAFTER; OPERATION OF THE FACILITY TO ACCEPT DELIVERED MSW; AND RELATED BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS. NEGOTIATED A FORM OF JOINDER AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO EACH CHARTER MUNICIPALITY AS A CONTRACTUAL BASIS FOR PROVIDING MSW TO THE FACILITY IN HAMPDEN FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF 15 YEARS STARTING ON APRIL 1, 2018. THE FORM OF JOINDER AGREEMENT PROVIDES A BASIS FOR ALLOCATION OF ALL OF THE CASH ASSETS OF THE EQUITY CHARTER MUNICIPALITIES AS OF APRIL 1, 2018. UNDER THAT ALLOCATION, 5.0 MILLION WOULD BE USED TO PURCHASE AND DEVELOP THE HAMPDEN SITE. THE REMAINING FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT THE ANTICIPATED MSW PROCESSING AND DISPOSAL ARRANGEMENTS GOING FORWARD FOR THOSE CHARTER MUNICIPALITIES THAT ENTER INTO JOINDER AGREEMENTS. THE ALLOCABLE SHARE OF SUCH FUNDS WOULD BE RETURNED TO EQUITY CHARTER MUNICIPALITIES THAT DO NOT ENTER IN JOINDER AGREEMENTS. THE MRC'S EXPENSES TO SUPPORT SUCH DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY RESERVES HELD IN THE MRC OPERATING BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PERMITTED USES OF SUCH FUNDS. AT THIS TIME, THE EFFORT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIBERIGHT FACILITY IN HAMPDEN REMAINS ON SCHEDULE AND THE MRC REMAINS CONFIDENT THAT SUCH FACILITY WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ACCEPT AND PROCESS MSW WHEN AND AS NEEDED. IN THE EVENT THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE FIBERIGHT FACILITY IS DELAYED OR LIMITED, MSW FROM THOSE ENTITIES THAT HAVE SIGNED JOINDER AGREEMENTS WOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE CROSSROADS LANDFILL UNDER THE TERMS OF THE WASTE DISPOSAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MRC AND THE CROSSROADS LANDFILL.

"For nearly 30 years, the Mitchell Institute has been dedicated to advancing Senator George J. Mitchell's mission to increase the likelihood that young people from every community in Maine will aspire to, pursue, and achieve a college education. We work with young people statewide who face uphill battles on their way to college, and we level the playing field for them by providing financial resources and a broad range of supports. Each year, the Institute selects at least one graduating senior from every public high school in Maine. In 2023, we awarded 166 graduating seniors a $10,000 scholarship each. Scholarship selection is based on academic excellence, community leadership, and financial need.(Continued on Schedule O)The 166 scholarships awarded in 2023 was 20 more than the previous year. In addition to the $10,000 scholarship, the Institute provides support including personal and professional development programming, opportunities for additional funding for internships and study abroad, and access to a network that provides lasting relationships and career advice. Since our founding in 1995, the Mitchell Institute has awarded more than $25 million in scholarship, fellowship, and contingency funds to more than 3,600 Scholars and Alumni who hail from every community in Maine. Our data shows that the more we engage with Mitchell Scholars, the more likely they are to graduate: 88% of Mitchell Scholars complete college and achieve a degree, compared with 58% of students nationally. 89% of Mitchell Scholar Alumni are working in career-related jobs-nearly two-thirds of them in Maine. While 44% of recent Mitchell Scholars were the first in their families to attend college and 80% came from households earning less than Maine's median family income, over 50% achieved earnings early in their careers that were higher than their entire family household income at the time they applied for the Mitchell Scholarship.",0,The summary focuses on providing scholarships and support for education without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts.

"Community-Based Services: Family Planning Association of Maine (FPA) provides funding, technical support and quality assurance to 46 clinics statewide in addition to operating clinics in Augusta, Belfast, Damariscotta, Farmington, Lewiston, Norway, Rockland, Rumford, Skowhegan, and Waterville serving the family planning needs of approximately 27,000 low-income Maine women, men and teens annually. FPA's services are confidential, offered on a sliding fee scale, state-of-the-art, and include: comprehensive medically accurate reproductive health care information to help clients make informed decisions about their reproductive health and lives gynecological exams colposcopy for evaluation of abnormal Pap tests family planning pregnancy testing and options counseling emergency contraception STD and HIV testing and treatment screenings for reproductive cancers first-trimester medication and aspiration abortion care servicesDuring 2013, 86% of our clients were low-income and a visit to one of our centers was often the only health care they received. Half of all sexually active Maine teens sought counseling and services from a family planning health center and many of these young people continue to use our trusted services through adulthood. In 2013, 5,379 teens were provided the care they needed to prevent unintended pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.According to 2005 data (the most recent data available), Maine's teen pregnancy rate is 3rd lowest in the nation. From 1998 to 2005, Maine's teen pregnancy rate dropped an amazing 48%. Education and Research Projects: In 2013, the FPA continued to provide Maine teens with sexual health information that is medically accurate and age appropriate. Designed with input from Maine teens, www.maineteenhealth.org provides sexual health information, a guide to Maine's family planning clinics, and an interactive place to get answers to their sexual health questions. The FPA's text messaging service, AskMTH, allows teens to use their cell phones to text anonymous questions and get answers from a trained family planning professional. In 2013, our text line fielded 314 questions from 94 different teens, indicating that teens find the service useful and return to it again and again. During FY2013, our teen website received and answered 104 questions from Maine teens.In 2013, Family Planning Association hired an Outreach and Marketing Coordinator to facilitate and strengthen partnerships between the FPA and other local and statewide organizations. Outreach collaborations work to reinforce and facilitate referrals to Family Planning clinics and other services, provide shared learning opportunities for FPA and partner agency staff, and solidify FPA as the leading resource for reproductive health care services and education in Maine. Locally, connections have been made with sexual assault, domestic violence, social service providers and case workers, and community-based public health programs; statewide collaborators include the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault, Maine Families home visitation program, MaineCare services, The Horizon Program (providing care and services for Mainers with HIV/AIDS), and Health Affiliates Maine (a network of behavioral health providers). Since January of 2013, over 80 in-person connections, some with formalized partnership agreements, have been made through the Outreach program. During FY2013, through the FPA's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, Prevention Coordinators worked with educators in 17 schools and community-based organizations statewide to deliver a variety of evidence-based, comprehensive sexuality education curriculums focused on preventing HIV/STDs and pregnancy, reaching 1,053 youth. In order to sustain sexuality education efforts, we continue to provide training and professional development through web-based sessions, in-person trainings and statewide conferences. In the past school year (2012-13), a total of 257 educators from schools, youth-serving organizations and government agencies attended these training opportunities.During FY2013, the FPA's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program also continued its work through the federally funded Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), partnering with Jobs for Maine's Graduates (JMG) to deliver evidence based programming. During the 2012-13 school year 310 students participated in the All4You! curriculum in 13 high schools located in Maine communities with high teen pregnancy rates. Evaluations showed increased knowledge and improved attitudes around HIV/STDs, pregnancy prevention, and behaviors that put teens at risk and preventive measures like abstinence, birth control and condom use.Similar to our community-based services, funding for the FPA's education and research projects is provided by State and Federal agencies (that also monitor program operations and outcomes), foundation grants and other restricted revenues. Agency and Mission-Related Projects: Since 1971, the FPA's Public Affairs staff has worked to protect the reproductive rights of all Maine citizens. The Family Planning Association is founded on the premise that Maine women and teens must have access to comprehensive reproductive health care and information in order to control their reproductive lives. The FPA Public Affairs efforts are designed to promote and protect programs and services statewide to ensure affordable access to family planning. In FY2013, the Family Planning Association of Maine focused much of its advocacy efforts on defeating legislation aimed at restricting access to reproductive health care in Maine. Despite the fact that Maine has repeatedly demonstrated its support for reproductive privacy in recent years, bills limiting this privacy continue to appear before the Maine Legislature, forcing the FPA and our coalition partners to dedicate considerable time and effort to defeat them. Each new legislative session brings new legislators who require education to dispel myths about reproductive health care and reproductive rights, and to help them recognize reproductive health care as basic health care for women, rather than simply a political issue. With the assistance of many coalition partners, the FPA was able to again defeat every bill that threatened reproductive health care in the 2013 legislative session.We continue to rely on a strong network of pro-choice, pro-family planning grassroots activists who communicate very powerfully with their elected representatives, and will continue to be vigilant in protecting and expanding access to the full range of reproductive health care for all women, men and teens in Maine.Private contributions and agency-endowed resources fund these projects. No public funds are used. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provided incentive funds to eligible providers to meet compliance guidelines associated with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). Also called """"meaningful use"""" funds, these awards allowed the FPA to focus on technology and training needs to adopt a successful Electronic Health Record (EHR) program and be able to use EHR to meet federal health policy priorities.",0,"The summary focuses on family planning, reproductive health services, and education without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"OVERVIEW AND SACRAMENTO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLOVERVIEWST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS (SHPS) OPENED ITS DOORS IN 2003 WITH A CLEAR VISION: TO CREATE ONE OF THE FINEST URBAN PRE-KINDERGARTEN THROUGH 12TH GRADE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN AMERICA. OUR STUDENTS ATTEND LONGER SCHOOL DAYS, ARE HELD TO HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR ACADEMICS AND BEHAVIOR AND FOCUS ON PREPARING TO OBTAIN A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OPERATES TRIUMPH CENTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, PS7 (K-8), OAK PARK PREP MIDDLE SCHOOL (7-8), AND SACRAMENTO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL (9-12).SACRAMENTO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLSACRAMENTO HIGH SCHOOL IS THE FINAL GATEWAY TO COLLEGE. IT IS ONE SCHOOL WITH FOUR THEMES, OR PATHWAYS-ARTS, BUSINESS AND COMMUNICATIONS, LAW AND PUBLIC SERVICE, MATH ENGINEERING AND HEALTH SCIENCES-IN A FULLY RENOVATED FACILITY THAT IS BRIGHT, AIRY AND OPEN. ALONG WITH CORE ACADEMICS, SAC HIGH HAS A CULTURE OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS, SCHOOL SPIRIT AND STUDENT LEADERSHIP. IT ALSO HAS A TIRELESSLY DEDICATED STAFF OR, AS ONE SENIOR PUT IT, """"WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT BREED OF TEACHER HERE."""" THE COLLECTIVE EFFORTS ARE EVIDENT IN MULTIPLE MEASURES. THE SCHOOL'S API HAS RISEN OVER 210 POINTS FROM 268 IN 2003 TO 780 IN 2013, MAKING THE SCHOOL THE HIGHEST PERFORMING OPEN-ENROLLMENT COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT. THIS IMPROVEMENT HAS OCCURRED WHILE THE DROPOUT RATE HAS DECREASED FROM OVER NINE PERCENT TO LESS THAN FOUR PERCENT AND SAC HIGH SAW THE HIGHEST GAINS IN READING OF ANY MIDDLE OR HIGH SCHOOL IN THE FOUR COUNTIES SURRONDING SACRAMENTO. FURTHERMORE, SAC HIGH DOES NOT JUST PROVIDE A HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION; IT BRINGS TOGETHER THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ALL ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, TURNING THE DISTANT HOPE FOR COLLEGE INTO A TANGIBLE REALITY. THIS IS MOST EVIDENT IN THE FACT THAT OVER 90% OF SAC HIGH'S CLASS OF 2014 HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACCEPTED INTO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE, JUST ONE MONTH INTO THEIR SENIOR YEAR.WE PROVIDE A UNIQUE NETWORK OF SCHOOLS THAT GUIDES OUR STUDENTS FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE. STUDENTS GRADUALLY BUILD A FOUNDATION OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY AND INNER CONFIDENCE EMPOWERING THEM TO BECOME EDUCATED LEADERS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. OUR RIGOROUS CURRICULUM HAS CLOSED THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES WHO GO ON TO COLLEGE.THE NATIONAL STATISTICS ARE DAUNTING: LESS THAN 40% OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS GO TO COLLEGE. BUT AT ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED, WE HAVE NOT ACCEPTED THAT FATE. IN 2011, OVER 70% OF OUR SENIORS WERE ACCEPTED TO MORE THAN 75 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, UP FROM JUST 20% IN 2003 WHEN SAC HIGH WAS RUN AS A TRADITIONAL DISTRICT SCHOOL. OUR VISION IS THAT EVERY ONE OF OUR STUDENTS WILL LEAVE US PREPARED TO COMPLETE COLLEGE AND WE ARE WORKING RELENTLESSLY WITH OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TOWARDS THIS GOAL. ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOL #7PS7 CONTINUES THE JOURNEY TO SUCCESS AT ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. PS7 HAS PRODUCED STUNNING RESULTS. IT IS RANKED AMONG THE TOP 10% OF SIMILAR SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS THE ONLY SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY NOMINATED FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS BLUE RIBBON AWARD IN 2010. WALK INTO ANY PS7 CLASSROOM AND THE SCENE IS THE SAME: A GROUP OF STUDENTS LEANING FORWARD, LISTENING INTENTLY AS A TEACHER ASKS QUESTIONS. THEN, A FLURRY OF HANDS ARE RAISED. THERE IS ARTWORK ON THE WALLS ALONG WITH A LIST OF EXPECTATIONS, CODES OF CONDUCT AND COMMITMENTS MADE. IF A CHILD AT PS7 DOES NOT PERFORM AT THE EXPECTED LEVELS, THAT STUDENT IS IDENTIFIED AND RE-TAUGHT UNTIL THEY HAVE MASTERED THE SKILL OR CONCEPT. NO CHILD FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS. NO CHILD IS LOST. AS A TESTAMENT TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS AND THE HARD WORK OF STAFF AND FAMILIES, PS7 WAS RANKED AS THE 8TH HIGHEST PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS RECENTLY NAMED CHARTER SCHOOL OF THE YEAR FOR THE STATE. OAK PARK PREPARATORYOAK PARK PREP IS THE NEWEST SCHOOL IN THE ST. HOPE FAMILY AND HAS CONTINUED THE TRADITION SET BY THOSE THAT OPENED BEFORE IT. IN JUST THE SCHOOL'S FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION, OAK PARK PREP BECAME THE HIGHEST PERFORMING STAND ALONE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN THE SAC CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND SIXTH HIGHEST PERFORMING OVERALL. IN ADDITION, OAK PARK PREP IS THE FIRST STAND ALONE MIDDLE SCHOOL TO SERVE THE OAK PARK NEIGHBORHOOD IN 50 YEARS. TRIUMPH CENTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENTTRIUMPH PRESCHOOL SETS THE TONE FOR WHAT IS TO COME AT ST. HOPE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHILDREN WHO ATTEND QUALITY PRESCHOOL HAVE STRONGER READING AND MATH SKILLS, ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE HELD BACK A GRADE, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AT TRIUMPH, CHILDREN BEGIN THE PATH TO BECOMING LIFE-LONG LEARNERS AND LEADERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO SERVING OTHERS. THE CLASSROOMS ARE ALIVE WITH HANDS-ON EXPLORATION AND LEARNING OF EVERY KIND, FROM RECITING POEMS TO PAINTING LETTERS WITH SHAVING CREAM. LESS THAN 25% OF TEACHERS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY PRESCHOOLS HOLD BACHELOR'S DEGREES, BUT EVERY TRIUMPH TEACHER HOLDS A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE OR HIGHER. ALONG WITH THE STAFF, FACULTY OF THE UC DAVIS HEALTH SYSTEM-INCLUDING A SPECIAL EDUCATION CONSULTANT, CHILD PSYCHIATRIST AND DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN-WORK WITH FAMILIES TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD'S INDIVIDUAL LEARNING NEEDS ARE MET. THE HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF AT TRIUMPH HAVE CREATED A REMARKABLE PROGRAM WIDELY RECOGNIZED FOR ITS SUCCESS IN RAISING STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT. TRIUMPH IS ONE OF ONLY THREE SCHOOLS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO REACH THE STANDARDS SET BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION FOR YOUNG CHILDREN FOR """"HIGH QUALITY AND IN 2010-11 TRIUMPH WAS NAMED A MODEL SITE BY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS WITH STUDENTS HAVING SEVERE AND PERVASIVE CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR. AS A RESULT, TRIUMPH HAS SHARED OUR BEST PRACTICES WITH TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS FROM INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOLS IN ELK GROVE UNIFIED AND SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL LOCAL HEADSTART PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, THE SCHOOL HAS CONTINUALLY SUSTAINED 95% FAMILY SATISFACTION EACH YEAR SINCE OPENING OUR DOORS. THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON PREPARING STUDENTS IS CLEAR AS TRIUMPH STUDENTS ARE ACHIEVING AT REMARKABLE LEVELS BOTH AT AND BEYOND TRIUMPH. PRIOR TO LEAVING TRIUMPH, STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE MASTERY OF 70% OF THE MATH STANDARDS AND OVER 50% OF THE LITERACY STANDARDS FOR KINDERGARTEN. 100% OF TRIUMPH'S FIRST CLASS OF ALUMNI WHO ATTEND PS7, SHPS' AWARD WINNING K-8 SCHOOL, WERE AT OR ABOVE GRADE LEVEL IN 2ND GRADE, COMPARED TO LESS THAN TWO THIRDS OF THEIR PEERS IN CALIFORNIA.",0,The summary focuses on educational achievements and programs without mentioning any religious or faith-based concepts.

"Treatment Foster Care Programs provide children who experience trauma, neglect, and/or behavioral health disorders a safe home with foster families who are licensed by the State to provide treatment level services and support. The children who are served in this program have moderate to high needs and require close supervision and therapeutic interactions and interventions. The staff in this program work with the birth families in order to reunify the family whenever possible. Staff also work with the children and foster parents to assist them in realizing goals in the child's individualized treatment plan. The goals of the Treatment Foster Care Program are to provide a temporary safe and nurturing home and family; to assist the children in dealing with trauma and mental health issues; to work with birth families so that reunification can be realized; and to work to support permanency for all children through reunification, kinship care, adoption, or independent living. Community Family Support Services provide community children and their families clinical behavioral health support in their own homes. The children in this program are diagnosed with a primary mental health diagnosis, and the family is identified as needing support to assist the child(ren) and to keep the family intact. Licensed clinicians and behavioral health specialists work as a team to provide the family with an array of individualized strength-based supports including family therapy, individual therapy, behavior modification interventions, parenting education, and structural family support. The goal of the CFSS program is to treat the child's mental health issues through working with the entire family in their own home setting, thereby avoiding out of home placement for the child. The Alternative Response Program (ARP) provides immediate safety and well-being evaluations for families where there have been allegations of abuse or neglect (low to moderate risk) toward children within the family. All referrals come directly from the DHHS after a report has been made to the department. Case Managers, all of whom are licensed social workers (LSW's), interview the children, parents, and all family members and evaluate the home situation to assess the level of risk to the children and develop a safety and support plan. The goal is to help keep the family intact with parenting training and support, resource development, financial support to dress emergent life need, and the development of healthy and safe interactions between all family members. After the evaluation period, case management can be continued for a period of three months in this program. Outpatient mental health and medication management for children, families, and adults in a clinical setting.

Please see the following excerpt from the Northern Light Health Annual Report 2021 to the Community for details of community benefit projects at NLH members:Community partnershipsTeamworkThe greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members."""" - Coretta Scott King These words strongly resonate when we look across our Northern Light Health community. If we measure a community's greatness by the compassionate actions of its members, then we are truly surrounded by greatness and there is much to celebrate. Our culture of caring begins with caring for one another and extends to the care we deliver to people across Maine in the many communities we serve. But if the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that compassion is evident not only in our excellent staff and community members but also in our community partners. Your generosity and innovation have helped extend our reach in living up to our promise to make healthcare work for the people we serve. Our list of community heroes is long, and this Annual Report only features a handful of the people and organizations who have made an important difference during a challenging time. We hope you find these stories as empowering and inspirational as we do.Timothy J. Dentry, MBA President & CEO Northern Light HealthKathy Corey Board ChairNorthern Light HealthA vaccine for everyone AccessOn a sunny July day, a brightly colored RV emblazoned with the faces of children from across the world sits parked outside the Luca Caf in Arundel. The Luca Caf is a quaint seasonal restaurant with Asian-inspired food that has covered outdoor seating and picnic tables. Standing beside some tables and folding chairs in front of the RV, Peggy Akers, RN, and Mary Robbins, RN, two Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses, administer doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to a diverse and willing group of peoplea group which might not have been vaccinated if not for the convenience of this mobile clinic and all the community partners that made it possible. There are populations that we are just not reaching. People who are undocumented, who would feel unsafe coming to a mass vaccination clinic where they might otherwise be asked to present identification or insurance information. We as an organization make it our mission that the only requirements for getting vaccinated are, are you a human being and do you want to be vaccinated? shares Robbins.Their partners for this clinic are Maine Community Action Partners, the New England Arab American Organization, Maine Association for New Americans, Maine Access Immigrant Network (MAIN), and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 Community Support Team. Chanbopha (Chan) Himm is also a member of the support team and co-founder of the Cambodian Community Association and Unified Asian Communities. Her mission is to help get people in underserved populations vaccinated. As some Asian Americans show up, she speaks with them in their native language and offers assurances. She has a welcoming smile and charisma, which seems to make her a natural fit for this kind of work. """"They couldn't ask for a better place to get vaccinated,"""" explains Himm, """"because they've got the nurses here that care so much about them. And then they've got their cultural brokersthe ones doing the translations, the community leaders standing right behind them and letting them know that they're going to be okay. What more can someone ask for?"""" Himm is not just offering lip service when she compliments the Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses doing the clinics. Both Akers and Robbins have been doing this kind of work for a long time with community partners and have earned praise for their compassion and sensitivity. """"I feel so lucky in a way to be part of this journey. Doing these vaccines has just been such a gift,"""" shares Akers.If you would like to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine or get vaccinated, please visit https://covid.northernlighthealth.org/Good health is good businessResiliencyA light summer breeze comes off the Union River as customers gather on picnic tables shaded by umbrellas on the lawn outside the Union River Lobster Pot restaurant in Ellsworth. They are hoisting glasses of cold draft beer as servers carry out plates piled high with steamed clams and boiled lobster garnished with leafy green parsley and lemon wedges. To restaurant owner Brian Langley, the summer of 2021 looks a lot different than the summer of 2020. It's a lot closer to normal, at least in terms of business volume. """"We've seen a real influx of customers looking to escape to Maine from wherever they were in the country. They had to get out, and they wanted to go someplace safe. Maine was the epitome of both of those things, says Langley.But as normal as things look, it was a challenge to get here. Like many business owners, Langley was dealing with so many unknowns. How could he keep employees and customers safe from COVID-19? How could he overcome supply chain issues, staffing shortages, social distancing requirements, and government mandates? For these questions and more, Langley turned to Northern Light Health which had started offering business-to-business webinars via the Zoom video conferencing portal. """"We call these webinars Good Health is Good Business,"""" explains Carrie Arsenault, MBA, president of Northern Light Beacon Health, which spearheads the webinar series. """"We bring experts together from across Northern Light Health and share resources and advice on how to return to business safely for employees, visitors, and customers."""" As a large employer dealing directly with COVID-19, Northern Light Health had the expertise and resources that business owners needed, with experts in infection prevention, supply chain, finance, and behavioral health, to name a few. """"One of the reasons you found me every two weeks watching the webinars was to get an idea of what we would be facing, explains Langley. I looked for trusted information, and there you had it from the horse's mouth. You could ask the doctors and other experts direct questions, and if they didn't know something they acknowledged that. It wasn't curated, it was objective and unbiased"""" Langley explains. A planning group meets regularly to discuss topics, create presentations, and book panelists. James Jarvis, MD, FAAFP, Physician Leader, Incident Command, Northern Light Health, is a frequent panelist because of his expertise in the COVID-19 response. """"Initially, I think they just wanted updates on what healthcare was doing and what was going on in our communities in relation to COVID-19. We realized that we needed to be a voice of science and reason to help mitigate fear. There was so much unknown in the beginning part of this pandemic that we felt an obligation to inform our businesses and communities of what we knew and what we thought was going to happen,"""" explains Dr. Jarvis. Another panelist, Yemaya St. Clair, LCPC, counselor, Northern Light Work Force EAP, was brought in to offer mental health advice to business owners. Many recognized that their employees, and in some cases customers, were struggling to cope with the new normal of the pandemic. """"Early on, when the masking mandates went into effect, we provided coaching around de-escalation, to help people stay calm. We also provided resiliency training and ways to help manage stress,"""" shares St. Clair. For Brian Langley, valuable advice helped him navigate an uncertain time, helped his employees cope, and provided current information to help adapt his business. He used the pandemic as an opportunity to try new menu items and offerings, such as outdoor seating. Eventually, Langley took what he learned and shared it with other business owners as a webinar panelist. """"What can I do that's different, and how do I survive? I think that's what I wanted to share,"""" explains Langley. Arsenault says Northern Light Beacon Health will continue offering the webinars as long as there is a community need. """"We are thrilled to be part of the solution to create healthy employees, healthy businesses and, as a result, healthy communities.""""Ladders of opportunityPart 1 DiversityWhen Ngozi Christopher, RN, BSN, first started working at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in 2017, she had already worked as a nurse for several years in Nigeria. She had clinical experience and a nursing education but didn't know how steep the cultural curve would be. She remembers one particularly difficult exchange with a patient's wife who was mad at Ngozi because she wouldn't make constant eye contact with her or her husband. """"In Nigeria, when you're talking to an elder, you're not supposed to look eye-to-eye because thats a sign of rudeness,"""" Ngozi explains.

"In 2019 TTF completed 30% design on the 22-mile unconstructed section of the proposed Pines to Mines Trail, which is now awaiting United States Forest Service (USFS) feedback. This project also involves working closely with project partners in western Nevada County (Bicyclists of Nevada County, Bear Yuba Land Trust, and Gold Country Trails Council).Over the summer of 2019, TTF made changes and additions to Trail A1 (Jackass Ridge Trail). Recognizing the popularity of this trail and the opportunity for improvement, the TTF and United States Forest Service (USFS) agreed there was an excellent opportunity to systemize the trail. Systemization legally requires that the trail meet current sustainability standards and avoid identified sensitive areas. TTF raised funds to conduct necessary resource studies, and worked with the USFS to ensure sensitive resources are protected. This project involved the adoption of 1.71 miles of existing user-created trail, and construction of an additional 2.0 miles of non-motorized singletrack trail, creating a trail loop system, all on public land. This project will provide a sustainable and long-lasting recreation opportunity for the public, while discouraging use of adjacent private land and avoiding sensitive cultural and natural resources. Work was conducted by TTF trail crew, USFS personnel, and volunteers at no cost to the public.Lower Carpenter Valley was recently purchased by the Truckee Donner Land Trust and is currently open to the public with their docent led hikes. In August of 2019 TTF's crew broke ground on a new 3 mile trail that will circumnavigate this stunning meadow. This project will continue during the summer of 2020.

"Operation of a contemporary museum located in the heart of downtown Bar Harbor, Maine focusing on the understanding and appreciation of the State of Maine's Native American heritage, culture, history, and archaeology. The Museum's collections, exhibitions, and programs focus on Native American traditions in Maine and explore the broader Native American experience, past and present. The history and cultures of Maine's Native American people, the Wabanaki, are showcased through changing exhibitions, special events, collection management, teacher workshops, archaeology field schools, and craft workshops for children and adults. Visitors find dynamic and stimulating exhibitions and activities interspersed with spaces for quiet reflection. In addition to the downtown location, from spring through fall, the Abbe's historic trailside museum at Sieur de Mont's Spring continues to offer visitors a step back in time to the early 20th century presentations of Native American archaeology in Maine.Admissions:The Museum had over 25,000 visits combined at our two locations. Visitors come from most of the USA plus many foreign countries.Curatorial Services:The Museum serves as one of the only two federally recognized repositories of archaeological artifacts in the State of Maine. In addition, the Museum houses an extensive collection of historic and contemporary Native American artwork and crafts which, in part, forms the basis for public exhibitions that highlight Native American culture.Education:The Museum provided educational progams to schools throughout Maine both on site and in the classroom. School programs address topics of archaeology, culture differences, trade economies, and stereotyping. The Museum provides a teacher training workshop, workshops and demonstrations for adults and children, and is an essential resource for helping teachers and students comply with new state legislation known as """"the Wabanaki Initiative."""" The Museum also provides educational opportunities for adults and children visiting Acadia National Park.Memberships:The Museum offers several levels of membership. Each level offers certain benefits. Some of the benefits are unlimited free admission, invitations to events, and newsletters. Stitching Ourselves Together ExhibitThis year saw the development of our newest exhibit, Stitching Ourselves Together, a collaboration between Wabanaki community members and the Museum. It is presented from a first-person perspective, with Mi'kmaq artisans and culture keepers sharing their experiences working with quills. Community curator Jennifer Pictou (Mi'kmaq) explains, """"When we, as Mi'kmaq people, are involved in the curation and narration of our own history we are able to correct the incomplete and often erroneous narratives assigned to our existence. Academics have often misidentified the motifs represented in our quill art or applied their own experiences and beliefs to our imagery. This Euro-centric interpretation negates our Indigenous use of symbols, styles, and patterns."""" Stitching Ourselves Together challenges common misconceptions around this traditional art form. The displays include historical and contemporary pieces from skilled Mi'kmaq quillworkers and artist profiles from the """"Quillers of the Dawn"""" group working to revive the art form. Alongside this exhibit we also presented our long running Waponahki Student Art Show, which showcases the works of students from the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Passamaquoddy Tribe at Motahkomikuk (Indian Township) and Sipayik (Pleasant Point), Mi'kmaq Nation, and Penobscot Nation at Panuwapskek (Indian Island). Digital AMIM The importance of creative placemaking and how it supports Wabanaki artists, and the local community, led us to create The Abbe Museum Indian Market in 2018. Over 50 Tribal artisans from across North America, representing over 30 Indigenous Nations, attended in its inaugural year.

"Head Start is a free preschool program for children ages 3-to-5 years until eligible for kindergarten. It is funded through the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Office of Head Start and the State Department of Health and Human Services. Grantees are expected to raise 20% of the cost of the program through local contributions of cash or in-kind goods and services. The federal program targets children living at or below the federal poverty rate but allows enrollment of children from other income levels under strict guidelines. At least 10% of children enrolled must have a diagnosed disability. The funded enrollment for the Head Start program is 224 children in center-based programs. Early Head Start is a program for infants and toddlers and is also funded through ACF.

Child and Adult Care Food Program, a program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, supports reimbursement for meals served in CFO's centers and through sponsorship agreements with about 40 family child care providers in Hancock, Washington, Penobscot and Waldo counties. The cost of meals is subsidized through this grant based on a family's income or eligibility for Head Start/Early Head Start. In exchange, providers agree to assure that meals and snacks meet nutritional standards. Technical assistance and training on nutrition and CACFP requirements are provided by agency staff.

"Energy Efficiency and Building Decarbonization:Acadia Center is transforming the region's building systems to make them more efficient and healthier. The project seeks to advance energy efficiency programs that provide incentives and support to consumers to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses, shifting billions of utility dollars from purchasing power plant contracts into energy efficiency programs including through state energy efficiency planning bodies across the region as well as through emerging policy concepts such as Clean Heat Standards (CHS). The project focuses on transitioning buildings to clean, efficient, all-electric heating and cooling systems and pursues this work through coalitions, state policies, a building-science approach, and innovative methods that make energy efficiency programs easier for consumers to participate in, specifically in environmental justice, rural and other historically underserved communities. These efforts encompass improving weatherization and addressing pre-weatherization barriers for the region's aging building stock, driving flexible loads and grid-interactive buildings, and synchronizing in-building electrification strategies with broader community- and neighborhood-level solutions like networked geothermal. The project further works to sustain and advance energy efficiency as a resource at a regional level, where it contributes some 12-14% of the region's power needs. Clean Energy and Infrastructure:Acadia Center advocates for accelerating the deployment of clean energy on the power grid, from large-scale resources like offshore wind to local, distributed renewables like community and rooftop solar. This work extends to the complex area of reforms to remove barriers to clean power in the regional electricity grid, where our goals include articulating the consumer, health, environmental justice, and climate case against persistent reliance on fossil fuel for electricity in the region. In addition to overarching reform work, the organization has initiated a suite of new grid- and infrastructure-focused projects intended to improve the responsiveness of power grids to consumer, climate, and equity goals. These include creating a forum for northeast regional grid planning across New England, New York, and eastern Canada; a set of analyses on the barriers to and solutions for harmonious siting and community engagement around large-scale grid infrastructure projects; and a novel effort to plug municipalities into the important work of the regional grid operator and help them shape outcomes there to advance local and state policy priorities.Clean Energy:Shifting electric power generation to zero and low-carbon resources is central to Acadia Center's core program work. As building and transportation sectors electrify, securing renewables and clean energy resources on the grid is vital to ensuring adequate renewable supply to keep pace with rising demand, power vehicles and heat pumps with clean electrons, and deliver economic and public health benefits to local communities. Acadia Center is focused on accelerating the deployment of diverse renewable resources that are and will be part of an optimized renewable portfolio for the region, including offshore wind, onshore wind, utility-scale solar, community solar, rooftop solar, clean hydropower, and beyond. The program undertakes policy advocacy and market reforms needed to remove barriers and spur adoption at the local, state, and regional levels from renewable portfolio standards to net energy metering rules, solar incentive programs, and large-scale procurements.Acadia Center has long advocated for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) program, which has delivered over $6 billion in funds to invest in clean energy and consumer benefits in 11 participating states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region. We lead regional advocacy calls on RGGI, develop recommendations to the states and RGGI, Inc., and prepare analyses and reports on both the program's benefits and ways to improve it.Clean Grid:Acadia Center has long played an important advocacy role before ISO-NE, NEPOOL, and their respective stakeholder committees and bodies, such as the Consumer Liaison Group (CLG). In conjunction with this work, the organization launched a new Communities and Clean Grid project focused on providing energy education resource material about the power grid to municipalities in the region. The objective of this project is to equip and empower local communities to understand better and potentially engage in and influence deliberative ISO New England grid planning and management processes, aiming to 1) place local communities on an equal footing with other stakeholders seeking to influence ISO-NE grid planning and management, and 2) enlist them in the region-wide effort to implement equitable, affordable clean energy solutions.Northeast Grid Planning Forum:The Northeast Grid Planning Forum (NGPF) is a deliberative stakeholder dialogue designed to formalize and deepen collaboration across northeast U.S. states and Canadian provinces around interregional energy systems and grid coordination. Acadia Center and Nergica, independent US and Canada-based non-profit corporations serve as co-convenors for this effort. The dialogue will be convened via three distinct roundtable processes: 1) environmental justice and community mobilization, 2) interregional planning, and 3) clean energy procurement and market development. Interregional grid coordination in this context includes a range of planning, investment, market design, community benefits, and operational approaches. Northeast states already share electrical connections with their Canadian neighbors, but a more holistic approach to planning and implementing improvements to the regional energy system will deliver significant value to New England ratepayers.Infrastructure and Community Engagement:Acadia Center is addressing the issue that to meet climate goals successfully, a large increase in renewable generation will require sufficient transmission and other infrastructure to be built. That increase will occur when communities and stakeholders value and support infrastructure development. This will require improvements in permitting processes to be inclusive and trustworthy of community and stakeholder participation. One near-term project Acadia Center is undertaking to understand better community needs in infrastructure siting and permitting is a partnership with colleagues at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF). Acadia Center and CATF are working together to design and understand better and help overcome barriers to the responsible siting and development of clean infrastructure in the region, including barriers related to community engagement and needs in permitting and siting processes. Utility Innovation and Accountability: Acadia Center advances thought-leading reforms in state and regional utility regulation so all parties engaged in the energy system utilities, regulators, and consumers work together to achieve shared goals. The program builds awareness about how outdated financial incentives influence utility decision-making and can misalign with clean energy deployment, climate goals, and ratepayer benefits. The program has significant reforms of public utility commissions and state regulatory oversight so that they consider climate impacts and equity imperatives alongside reliability, affordability, and safety. Program goals seek to catalyze modernization of the grid and the utility system of the future, with a focus on performance-based regulation, utility performance incentive mechanisms, rate-design for electrification and DERS, integrated distribution system planning (gas/electric), non-wires alternatives, and inclusive stakeholder engagement. Climate Policy and Solutions:Every program and project at Acadia Center touches on climate policy and solutions. Climate Policy represents a dedicated set of activities specifically focused on addressing opportunities for states and the region to achieve overarching climate targets, which require deep, economy-wide decarbonization and phaseout of the use of fossil fuels. Program area activities include engaging with states on comprehensive climate planning studies, modeling, and energy system strategies. This work advances long-term, """"big picture thinking,"""" which is needed to ensure that comprehensive and cohesive strategies for decarbonizing entire economies are considered. Climate Policy includes work in Acadia Center's CLEAN-E Analysis team. It embraces three project areas that are essential to the achievement of near- and long-term climate targets at a state and regional level: 1) Fossil Fuel Phase-Out, and 2) State and Regional Climate Policies, which includes work on programs that set binding caps on emissions (e.g., RGGI, cap-and-invest).Climate, Energy, and Equity Analysis (CLEAN-E):Acadia Center develops analytic materials and independent, thought-leading recommendations across various clean energy and climate issues. Work products created by our Climate, Energy, and Equity Analysis program include 1) comprehensive, proactive reports, 2) analytically focused comments to government agencies and filings with regulatory bodies, and 3) rapid response offense/defense analysis. In recent years, we have produced groundbreaking reports about building electrification, the RGGI program, and issues around claims for clean fuels. Work performed in 2023 includes comprehensive assessments of the climate impacts of fuels such as hydrogen and """"renewable natural gas; in-depth analyses of technical issues related to shaping an effective Clean Heat Standard for building decarbonization; and original research that found sizeable public health impacts of smaller fossil fuel powerplants that fall under the radar in policy arenas.Fossil Fuel Phase-Out:To meet climate goals, the region must almost entirely phase out its use of fossil gas, commonly referred to as natural gas and other fossil fuels. Acadia Center seeks to replace fossil gas with clean energy alternatives in electricity production, building heating, and transportation. This conversion necessarily requires the downsizing and decommissioning fossil fuel infrastructure and supply chain networks, such as gas distribution system transition. This project advances proposals to level the playing field for renewables and efficient electric technologies and shrink the reliance on fossil fuels across the region and all program areas. As the electric sector faces an approaching need to develop and deploy dispatchable, emissions-free resources (DEFR) such as long-duration storage, green hydrogen, and other potential resources, Acadia Center is engaging closely on the question of how to address reliability and resource adequacy role currently served by fossil fuels, including reliance on dual-fuel oil/gas and LNG resources for winter reliability.Transportation and Mobility:Acadia Center accelerates the transition to low-carbon transportation. We advance policy approaches that address transportation emissions and invest in equitable access to clean mobility solutions, including solutions that specifically focus on disproportionate impacts and gaps in service in underserved urban and rural communities. The solutions we promote range from electric vehicles and zero-emission buses and trucks to transit, rail, and biking/walking infrastructure, among other measures to reduce emissions and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). We strive to help states evolve the way they and their DOTs plan for and invest in their traditional transportation assets to a model that is compatible with emissions reduction requirements while also ensuring that the region's construction workforces see a vibrant future even as funding is shifted away from, e.g., highway expansion projects. Our vision also includes place-based decarbonization interventions at key hubs within the region's transportation system, including ports, freight terminals, and airports. After the Transportation and Climate Initiative's (TCI) cessation, Acadia Center continues to coordinate advocates working on transportation and equity issues. It may resume focusing on the potential for cap-and-invest to drive equitable transportation emissions reductions through broader economywide models.Equity and Environmental Justice:Embedded across Acadia Center's work is addressing climate and clean energy policies and solutions designed to improve the lives of all residents and specifically redress the detrimental impacts of a fossil fuel economy on lower-income urban and rural communities. Acadia Center internally applies diversity, equity, and environmental justice through staff discussions, materials, approaches, and engagement. Programs seek to connect and build relationships with community-based organizations and diverse stakeholders to improve energy system decisions and planning to be inclusive and responsive to community needs. These efforts seek to place and keep environmental justice solutions at the forefront of state and regional initiatives that formerly overlooked this vital imperative.Communications and Public Engagement:A core focus of Acadia Center's approach to climate is to consider how the organization's program efforts should resonate with decision-makers, media, communities, and the broader public. To those goals, program work includes developing educational and explanatory materials that raise awareness about the benefits of a clean energy economy in accessible, digestible formats. Using top-notch graphic design, these innovative materials connect clean energy and climate progress with issues of concern to the public's daily lives, such as economic prosperity, equity, health, quality of life, and climate benefits. Acadia Center staff participate in numerous public forums and produce original analyses and reports. In 2023, the organization launched a new Climate and Energy Explainer Series that has addressed complex issues that the organization is addressing in its program work, such as clean energy technologies available on the power grid, the lifecycle implications of claims for """"renewable natural gas; what a Clean Heat Standard is and why it can be a powerful building decarbonization tool if done correctly and other topics. The Climate and Energy Explainer Series will continue with monthly reports throughout 2024.",0,"The summary focuses on energy efficiency, clean energy, and environmental justice without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"Access to Essential Services, Housing and Education:Mano en Mano's long-standing programs in 2023 continued to meet the needs of immigrant and farmworker communities in Maine. Highlights include: responding to 6,162 requests for assistance for basic needs and referrals; welcoming and celebrating migrant workers; opening a food pantry visited by 5,802 individuals during the year; disbursing award monies to community members from the housing barrier relief fund for down payment and renovations; running bilingual childcare and nearly completing construction on a new childcare facility; and providing services to 363 migrant children/youth across Maine. Access and Advocacy:Access to essential services and advocacy address the lack of effective services available to immigrants and farmworkers in Maine that prevent these communities from meeting basic needs or pursuing long-term goals. Accomplishments include: answering 12,585 requests for assistance and referrals, welcoming 4,242 migrant and seasonal workers during the wreaths and wild blueberry seasons, distributing hard-to-access culturally relevant food to community members, and conducting 95% of community member encounters in a language other than English. Housing:We provided six units of affordable housing for farmworkers at Hand in Hand apartments in 2023, housing a total of 23 individuals. We awarded 7 grants from the Housing Barrier Removal Fund to community members for downpayment or repair assistance for them to become or remain homeowners and support wealth accumulation.

Rayitos de Sol Bilingual Childcare:In 2023 Mano en Mano's Rayitos de Sol Bilingual Childcare operated with the core mission of providing bilingual Spanish and English childcare that centers the languages and cultlures of the students we serve. The childcare served 21 families (24 children enrolled) during the year, with 50% of families receiving subsidies and support through the DHHS Childcare Subsidy program. The childcare provided stable long-term employment for staff, who earned $5.75-$8.75 more per hour than the average Maine childcare employee. Lastly, in 2023 Mano en Mano completed the bulk of construction on a new facility to house the Rayitos de Sol Childcare, which is anticipated to open in 2024. Migrant Education Program:Mano en Mano partners with the Maine Department of Education to administer the Maine Migrant Education Program (MEP). Through this program Mano en Mano provides educational support services to migrant children and youth, from birth through age 21, across Maine. MEP programming aims to help migrant children and youth achieve their educational goals, with a focus on educational transition support, seasonal instructional support, and advocacy support within school and education systems. In 2023, we served 363 migrant children and youth, providing 14,025 direct services in the areas of advocacy, parent involvement, virtual tutoring, and summer services, including the blueberry harvest school, a three-week summer school for migrant students in Washington county during the blueberry harvest. Community Health Support:Mano en Mano continued COVID-19 response and community health and wellness programs in 2023 to support community members through the ongoing pandemic. Support included supporting community members with basic needs to address disparities related to social determinants of health, vaccine outreach and education, a community health worker program, and funding for soft infrastructure to support health equity.",0,"The summary focuses on providing essential services, housing, education, and health support to immigrant and farmworker communities without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."
