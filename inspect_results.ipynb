PROGRAM SERVICES ARE DELIVERED IN THE CONSUMER'S COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF MAINE ON AN ITINERANT BASIS AND INCLUDE VISION REHABILITATION THERAPY AND COUNSELING IN THE AREA OF ADJUSTMENT TO BLINDNESS. THE VISION REHABILITATION THERAPY COMPONENT ADDRESSES MULTIPLE AREAS OF LEARNING INCLUDING COMMUNICATIONS, ADAPTIVE KITCHEN SKILLS, HOME MANAGEMENT, PERSONAL MANAGEMENT, RECREATION, ORIENTATION AND MOBILITY TRAINING, AND THE USE OF VIDEO MAGNIFICATION EQUIPMENT AND SCREEN READING SOFTWARE AS APPROPRIATE. RESIDENT SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM: THE IRIS NETWORK PROVIDES ONGOING RESIDENT SUPPORT SERVICES TO CERTAIN VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR BLIND RESIDENTS OF IRIS PARK APARTMENTS WHO ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL DISABILITIES. IRIS PARK APARTMENTS FEATURES (30) ONE AND TWO BEDROOM INDEPENDENT LIVING APARTMENTS WHICH ARE SEPARATELY OWNED BUT MANAGED BY THE IRIS NETWORK. VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR BLIND TENANTS WITH MULTIPLE DISABILITIES ARE ABLE TO LIVE AS INDEPENDENTLY AS THEY DESIRE, SCHEDULE THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES, AND CREATE A PERSONAL PLAN FOR ASSISTED LIVING SERVICES. THE IRIS NETWORK OFFERS VISION REHABILITATION THERAPY TO PROVIDE TENANTS SUPPORT IN ALL AREAS OF INDEPENDENT LIVING. THE RESIDENT SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM AT IRIS PARK APARTMENTS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE IRIS NETWORK IN THAT THESE SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON AN ONGOING BASIS, RATHER THAN AS INSTRUCTION OR TEACHING DESIGNED TO ALLOW CLIENTS TO LEARN NEW SKILLS AND USE THOSE SKILLS INDEPENDENTLY AFTER SERVICES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED. LOW-VISION CLINIC PROGRAM: THE IRIS NETWORK'S LOW-VISION CLINIC PROVIDES VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS WITH THE SKILLS AND TOOLS TO BETTER UTILIZE THEIR REMAINING VISION. AFTER A LOW-VISION EXAMINATION, AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST OR OPTOMETRIST DEVELOPS A SPECIALIZED TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR EACH CLIENT ADMINISTERED BY AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST WITH SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN LOW-VISION SERVICES. THE PROGRAM HELPS INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING VISION LOSS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THEIR REMAINING VISION BY TRAINING EACH CLIENT IN THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO USE OPTICAL AIDS AND EQUIPMENT SUCH AS MAGNIFIERS TO READ THE NEWSPAPER OR LABELS ON PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, TELESCOPES TO FOCUS ON DISTANT SIGNS, AND LIGHT-FILTERED LENSES TO REDUCE GLARE. ACCESS TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PROGRAM: THE IRIS NETWORK'S ACCESS TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PROGRAM HAS TWO COMPONENTS. IT IS PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO TEACH PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED TO USE ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS INFORMATION NEEDED TO CARRY OUT THEIR JOBS, OR TO OBTAIN COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT. THE ACCESS TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO EMPLOYERS WISHING TO MAKE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO ENABLE EMPLOYEES WITH VISION LOSS TO WORK OR CONTINUE WORKING.

Please see the following excerpt from the Northern Light Health Annual Report 2021 to the Community for details of community benefit projects at NLH members:Community partnershipsTeamworkThe greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members.\"\" - Coretta Scott King These words strongly resonate when we look across our Northern Light Health community. If we measure a community's greatness by the compassionate actions of its members, then we are truly surrounded by greatness and there is much to celebrate. Our culture of caring begins with caring for one another and extends to the care we deliver to people across Maine in the many communities we serve. But if the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that compassion is evident not only in our excellent staff and community members but also in our community partners. Your generosity and innovation have helped extend our reach in living up to our promise to make healthcare work for the people we serve. Our list of community heroes is long, and this Annual Report only features a handful of the people and organizations who have made an important difference during a challenging time. We hope you find these stories as empowering and inspirational as we do.Timothy J. Dentry, MBA President & CEO Northern Light HealthKathy Corey Board ChairNorthern Light HealthA vaccine for everyone AccessOn a sunny July day, a brightly colored RV emblazoned with the faces of children from across the world sits parked outside the Luca Caf in Arundel. The Luca Caf is a quaint seasonal restaurant with Asian-inspired food that has covered outdoor seating and picnic tables. Standing beside some tables and folding chairs in front of the RV, Peggy Akers, RN, and Mary Robbins, RN, two Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses, administer doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to a diverse and willing group of peoplea group which might not have been vaccinated if not for the convenience of this mobile clinic and all the community partners that made it possible. There are populations that we are just not reaching. People who are undocumented, who would feel unsafe coming to a mass vaccination clinic where they might otherwise be asked to present identification or insurance information. We as an organization make it our mission that the only requirements for getting vaccinated are, are you a human being and do you want to be vaccinated? shares Robbins.Their partners for this clinic are Maine Community Action Partners, the New England Arab American Organization, Maine Association for New Americans, Maine Access Immigrant Network (MAIN), and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 Community Support Team. Chanbopha (Chan) Himm is also a member of the support team and co-founder of the Cambodian Community Association and Unified Asian Communities. Her mission is to help get people in underserved populations vaccinated. As some Asian Americans show up, she speaks with them in their native language and offers assurances. She has a welcoming smile and charisma, which seems to make her a natural fit for this kind of work. \"\"They couldn't ask for a better place to get vaccinated,\"\" explains Himm, \"\"because they've got the nurses here that care so much about them. And then they've got their cultural brokersthe ones doing the translations, the community leaders standing right behind them and letting them know that they're going to be okay. What more can someone ask for?\"\" Himm is not just offering lip service when she compliments the Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses doing the clinics. Both Akers and Robbins have been doing this kind of work for a long time with community partners and have earned praise for their compassion and sensitivity. \"\"I feel so lucky in a way to be part of this journey. Doing these vaccines has just been such a gift,\"\" shares Akers.If you would like to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine or get vaccinated, please visit https://covid.northernlighthealth.org/Good health is good businessResiliencyA light summer breeze comes off the Union River as customers gather on picnic tables shaded by umbrellas on the lawn outside the Union River Lobster Pot restaurant in Ellsworth. They are hoisting glasses of cold draft beer as servers carry out plates piled high with steamed clams and boiled lobster garnished with leafy green parsley and lemon wedges. To restaurant owner Brian Langley, the summer of 2021 looks a lot different than the summer of 2020. It's a lot closer to normal, at least in terms of business volume. \"\"We've seen a real influx of customers looking to escape to Maine from wherever they were in the country. They had to get out, and they wanted to go someplace safe. Maine was the epitome of both of those things, says Langley.But as normal as things look, it was a challenge to get here. Like many business owners, Langley was dealing with so many unknowns. How could he keep employees and customers safe from COVID-19? How could he overcome supply chain issues, staffing shortages, social distancing requirements, and government mandates? For these questions and more, Langley turned to Northern Light Health which had started offering business-to-business webinars via the Zoom video conferencing portal. \"\"We call these webinars Good Health is Good Business,\"\" explains Carrie Arsenault, MBA, president of Northern Light Beacon Health, which spearheads the webinar series. \"\"We bring experts together from across Northern Light Health and share resources and advice on how to return to business safely for employees, visitors, and customers.\"\" As a large employer dealing directly with COVID-19, Northern Light Health had the expertise and resources that business owners needed, with experts in infection prevention, supply chain, finance, and behavioral health, to name a few. \"\"One of the reasons you found me every two weeks watching the webinars was to get an idea of what we would be facing, explains Langley. I looked for trusted information, and there you had it from the horse's mouth. You could ask the doctors and other experts direct questions, and if they didn't know something they acknowledged that. It wasn't curated, it was objective and unbiased\"\" Langley explains. A planning group meets regularly to discuss topics, create presentations, and book panelists. James Jarvis, MD, FAAFP, Physician Leader, Incident Command, Northern Light Health, is a frequent panelist because of his expertise in the COVID-19 response. \"\"Initially, I think they just wanted updates on what healthcare was doing and what was going on in our communities in relation to COVID-19. We realized that we needed to be a voice of science and reason to help mitigate fear. There was so much unknown in the beginning part of this pandemic that we felt an obligation to inform our businesses and communities of what we knew and what we thought was going to happen,\"\" explains Dr. Jarvis. Another panelist, Yemaya St. Clair, LCPC, counselor, Northern Light Work Force EAP, was brought in to offer mental health advice to business owners. Many recognized that their employees, and in some cases customers, were struggling to cope with the new normal of the pandemic. \"\"Early on, when the masking mandates went into effect, we provided coaching around de-escalation, to help people stay calm. We also provided resiliency training and ways to help manage stress,\"\" shares St. Clair. For Brian Langley, valuable advice helped him navigate an uncertain time, helped his employees cope, and provided current information to help adapt his business. He used the pandemic as an opportunity to try new menu items and offerings, such as outdoor seating. Eventually, Langley took what he learned and shared it with other business owners as a webinar panelist. \"\"What can I do that's different, and how do I survive? I think that's what I wanted to share,\"\" explains Langley. Arsenault says Northern Light Beacon Health will continue offering the webinars as long as there is a community need. \"\"We are thrilled to be part of the solution to create healthy employees, healthy businesses and, as a result, healthy communities.\"\"Ladders of opportunityPart 1 DiversityWhen Ngozi Christopher, RN, BSN, first started working at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in 2017, she had already worked as a nurse for several years in Nigeria. She had clinical experience and a nursing education but didn't know how steep the cultural curve would be. She remembers one particularly difficult exchange with a patient's wife who was mad at Ngozi because she wouldn't make constant eye contact with her or her husband. \"\"In Nigeria, when you're talking to an elder, you're not supposed to look eye-to-eye because thats a sign of rudeness,\"\" Ngozi explains. She now understands that generally, eye contact is important in western culture. Ngozi was recruited to work at the medical center through Northern Light Health's international nurses' program.

ITS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A ZIONIST SIMPLY BELIEVES THAT ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO EXIST IN PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE LOCATION OF THE ANCESTRAL HOMELAND OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, AND MOST JEWS CONSIDER ISRAEL AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR JEWISH IDENTITY.

Of the 100,351 individuals served, 41,592 were children. One out of four children suffer from hunger in the Dallas/FW Area Many of these people are without jobs, others disabled and many seniors. Some families support children whose parents are in prison. Each family is qualified by the TEXCAP eligibility guidelines of the State of Texas to determine their income level. We provided emergency food four days a week in Tarrant and Dallas Counties by partnering with Central Dallas Ministries and Abundant Life Church in Dallas, with distribution from The HOPE Center in Fort Worth. We also distribute Clothes each week to assist individuals needing clothes for employment or other needs. Also childrens school clothes and school supplies are distributed. During the Christmas Holiday, we have a large Toy distribution for children who have been registered to families who receive food. The School of HOPE was birthed to \"\"Feed HOPE\"\" in the lives of individuals seeking employment. Since 2007 we have had tremendous growth not only in students but also in classes offered. In East Fort Worth over 50% of the high school students are drop outs. We offer Pre-GED and GED Programs to help students get back on track and to either go on to college or qualify for more job opportunities. For those seeking computer skills, we offer Keyboard 101 and Microsoft Office Suite. For employment in warehouses, we offer Forklift and Scissor Lift certification. Over 150 student have received employment through our certification programs. In 2008 The Hope Center initiated The KEYS of HOPE, an after school and summer program for children to learn how to play the keyboard and sing in a choir. They performed throughout the community. In 2010, The Keys of HOPE partnered with Children of Glory School of Fine Arts, to expand our music training. The School of Fine Arts met at The HOPE Center and is a DBA under the covering of The HOPE Center. We continue to have after school and summer training, but it has been expanded to include not only music lessons in keyboard, voice and choir, but also dance. Performances are done on a regular basis in churches in the community. Program services expenses support the distribution of food and goods to the needy and partnering organizations. These include expenses for delivery vehicles, forklifts, warehouse utilities, personnel and repairs. There are currently over 500 active volunteers who assist in The HOPE Center\\'s activities.',\n",

A significant accomplishment made possible by donors' unwavering support is that the ChaplainCare Learning Academy can now equip chaplains with the necessary education, training, and certification as professional individual and family resilience instructors and facilitators. This achievement underscores the Foundation's commitment to providing balanced and impartial support to the Chaplain Religious Enrichment Development Operation (CREDO) program. With the substantial investment in the ChaplainCare App, made possible by loyal donors' contributions, chaplains at one of the busiest airports in the United States now have access to a vital tool. The impact of donors' contributions extends far beyond the airport gates. This technology empowers command administrations, K-12 school districts, and corporate and governmental chaplaincies to fulfill their missions more effectively; versions 2 and 3 of the ChaplainCare App, currently in development, will further enhance our capacity to provide prevention, intervention, and postvention support that benefit thousands of military personnel, veterans, retirees, team members, students, and their families. Donors' commitment to our cause has made a lasting impact, creating a brighter future for our communities. Grants and Ministerial Stipends for a Cohort of Students at Asbury Theological Seminary. Loyal donors' gifts, Asbury Theological Seminary's scholarships, and student contributions enable the Foundation to provide grants and ministerial stipends for under-resourced, underrepresented seminarians serving underserved rural faith communities. Because of donor generosity, three students in our seminary cohort graduated student-loan-debt-free. Your generosity transforms lives and shapes the future of ministry leaders without financial burden. Good Samaritan Outreach Ministry Grant provided a unique online interfaith Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE) opportunity for non-traditional candidates (Spanish speaking and bilingual) to practice and serve under-served populations.

The culmination of more than 10 years of work in the field has finally been realized in these beautifully edited and fully licensed print publications. In addition, New Song has enabled Root to continue the established New Song teacher-training program that utilizes these curricula materials for children's camps, schools, churches, and other public and private venues. Root has also, with New Song's support and input, uploaded 3 introductory 1-hour videos introducing the self-worth message targeting parents in their online parent-training programs. Finally, in addition to the 3 newly licensed printed curriculum manuals, New Song has enabled Root to edit digital versions of three correlated Bible studies for distribution to those interested in pursuing the Biblical bases for this unique self-worth message.\",\n",

BILH continues to focus on the behavioral health care needs of its communities as well. BILH Network Accomplishments and Activities - Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023Throughout the period covered by this filing, Beth Israel Lahey Health (\"\"BILH\"\") and its affiliates focused on expanding access and services, including to underserved patient populations in order to reduce health inequities. In addition, there was a strong focus on continuing to provide high quality care at a lower cost, when appropriate, as demonstrated by BILH\\'s efforts to leverage community settings, keep care within the BILH Performance Network (\"\"BILHPN\"\"), and allow patients to receive care in their homes. The following highlights specific efforts during the period covered by this filing:Access & Expansion to Pharmacy Services - BILH Pharmacy has continued to expand its contractual relationships, allowing more patients to utilize its pharmacy for their prescriptions. In FY 2023, BILH Pharmacy successfully negotiated access to the Point32Health specialty pharmacy network as well as the WellSense Medicaid Accountable Care Organization (\"\"ACO\"\") plan. Examples of BILH Pharmacy\\'s other efforts to expand patient access to medications include: - Enhanced medication authorization and access services to help patients obtain necessary insurance authorizations and find co-pay assistance, - Expanded the medication refill center to assist patients and providers in expediting medication renewals and ensuring prescribed medication and dosage are still appropriate, - Extended patient co-pay assistance programs to the Joslin Adult Diabetes clinic and Northeast Hospital Corporation patients, and - Expanded clinical pharmacy services in ambulatory clinics to help manage and optimize patients\\' complex medication therapies. - BILH Pharmacy also expanded its clinical pharmacy presence in clinics to reduce the health equity gap in the use of highly impactful medications to treat patients with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases by improving their blood pressure and hemoglobin A1C. Interventions centered around prescribing evidence-based medications, educating patients about their conditions, and ensuring access to medication. Initial results have demonstrated an increase in the use of GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors by 32% in Black and Hispanic populations, an average reduction in hemoglobin A1c of 0.8, and a decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressures of 7mmHg and 2mmHg respectively.Improvement in Lab Services - BILH optimized the transportation routes of collected laboratory specimens to testing laboratories, ensuring high standards for turnaround times and maximum efficiency. This is foundational to the system\\'s ability to consolidate testing, expand access to in-network laboratory services which in turn generally reduces cost, and support the provision of high-quality care and the clinician and patient experience. - Focus remained strong in developing physician practice delivery models and re-opening patient service centers. These efforts enhance community providers\\' ability to use BILH labs and increase patient access to BILH labs.Leveraging In-Network Care - BILH operates a Transfer Center that facilitates patient access to the appropriate placement of patient transfers. With the creation of the Transfer Center, BILH has been able to retain patients who might otherwise have gone outside of the system. By expanding its focus to community hospitals, BILH has enhanced its ability to place patients, including at locations potentially closer to the patients\\' homes. - BILHPN operates a centralized referral management program that focuses on patients seeking out-of-network specialty care and redirecting them to in-network specialty care, when clinically appropriate. Throughout FY 2023, BILHPN redirected well over one thousand patient visits. In most cases, care retained within BILH resulted in enhanced care coordination at a lower cost of care.Enabling Patients to Receive Care at Home - BILH launched its Hospital at Home program in FY 2023, starting with Lahey Clinic Hospital d/b/a Lahey Hospital & Medical Center. This has allowed eligible patients to be offered care in the setting most comfortable for them - their homes - while also customizing care plans and improving patients\\' mobility even while they are acutely ill. - In FY 2023, BILHPN put programs in place to manage length of stay at skilled nursing facilities (\"\"SNFs\"\"), reduce readmissions, and discharge medically appropriate patients directly to their homes with homecare services instead of to a SNF, provided patients are medically stable to return home after an acute care stay and will likely have better outcomes and lower cost of care.Behavioral Health - In FY 2023, BILH Behavioral Services launched its Community Behavioral Health Center (\"\"CBHC\"\") in Lawrence, Massachusetts, consolidating outpatient, mobile crisis intervention, and adult community crisis stabilization services. The establishment of the CBHC is a part of the Commonwealth\\'s Executive Office of Health and Human Services Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform. - In addition, as part of the Roadmap for Behavioral Health Reform, BILH launched an Emergency Services Redesign that shifts emergency evaluations out of the Emergency Department (\"\"ED\"\"). BILH Behavioral Services also expanded its ED integration efforts to a total of six EDs, including Addison Gilbert Hospital, Anna Jaques Hospital, Beverly Hospital, Lahey Medical Center-Peabody, Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Milton, and Winchester Hospital.Health Equity - BILH and Lawyers for Civil Rights launched a medical-legal partnership to provide free legal support to low-income patients, beginning at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The collaboration will expand BILH\\'s ability to address health equity and expand access to health care for patients living in under-resourced communities. - BILHPN focused on reducing health equity disparities in diabetes and hypertension management by stratifying health outcomes by race, ethnicity and language; sharing performance data with primary care groups; and implementing clinical initiatives such as off-hour clinics, home blood pressure monitor distribution, continuous glucose monitoring, and outreach to patients with higher needs.Ongoing Intiatives:Enhanced Access for MassHealth Patients - To mitigate barriers in access to care and increase the number of MassHealth patients that BILH serves, the system committed to universal network-wide provider participation in MassHealth. All BILH hospitals and providers employed by BILH or on whose behalf BILH jointly contracts participate in and/or have applied to participate in some form of MassHealth. In FY 2022, BILH signed a new MassHealth ACO contract with BMC HealthNet Plan / WellSense Health Plan that went into effect in April 2023. As part of this contract, BILHPN extended participation to all eligible primary care providers (\"\"PCPs\"\") who were not otherwise participating in a MassHealth ACO. Prior to that time, while all eligible BILHPN PCPs were participants in a form of MassHealth, some PCPs were not previously participating in a MassHealth ACO. - BILH has developed, refined and implemented a multicultural marketing, advertising, and outreach plan with the purpose of expanding access for underserved populations, including MassHealth patients, in targeted BILH service areas.

       " 'Word Radio Educational Foundation was organized to provide a platform to establish non-commercial educational Christian radio broadcasting to communities within the reach of its radio broadcasting facilities which would proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ and teach Judeo Christian principles for life. Word Radio continues its outreach through WSEW 88.7 FM broadcasting from Sanford, Maine, to points in southern Maine, seacoast and inner regions of New Hampshire, and northeastern Massachusetts along the I-95 corridor to Boston. Word Radio brings together its four other radio stations in a separate but similar format known as Community Life Radio, operating WRKJ 88.5 FM in Gorham, Maine, reaching into the Westbrook-Portland area, WMTP 91.1 FM to the Mount Washington Valley region, WWPC 91.7 FM Lakes Region ME/NH, and WMEK 88.3 FM in Kennebunkport, Maine continuing during this report period. FUNDING: Funding to support the ministry of Word Radio and its broadcasting outlets comes through the generosity of individual donors, participation by program producers, and partnerships with churches, ministries and interested businesses that share the goal of providing Christian programming to their communities. A Christmas Gifts and Year End Giving Campaign was undertaken again this year in November and December by on-air spots and updates with over $36,000 coming in from listeners response. Again this year we were able to conduct the fundraising effort without any disruption in broadcasting daily format by short daily reports of the funding progress. This method of conducting the fundraiser was gratefully appreciated and unique from most fundraising methodologies. As with last year a small percentage of our estimated listenership actually participated in the fundraiser. We are thankful for the few listeners who care enough to participate in our radio service funding to sustain our presence both for themselves and others. We continue to be thankful to a small base of regular supporters and many donors who respond when prompted by God to do so and we receive His provision through them. Because our listeners also support many of the programs heard on Word Radio and Community Life Radio, their contributions help to continue the excellent biblical teaching heard each day on the stations. Because many program producers share back with the stations by returning a percentage of the donations directly attributable to the listeners of the radio stations, then there is again a broad base of supporters who give indirectly as well to the work of Christian broadcasting heard on all of our stations. There is also a base of impact partners who participate in the financial support and includes churches, ministries and Christian businesses who believe in the eternal effect of broadcasting the Word of God over the airwaves. FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS - Throughout 2014 great effort was expended in radio engineering, FCC license applications, legal oversight, and finalized construction activities for WMEK, Kennebunkport. The result was that the operational listening area was greatly increased in and around Kennebunkport, Kennebunk, Biddeford and surrounding areas on 88.3 Mhz. In June 2015, we completed the installation of the main studio 48kw Kohler standby generator including automatic transfer. Partial funding for this project was from a grant of $15,000 from the Davis Foundation. PROGRAMMING FORMAT - Word Radio continues to operate a second separately programmed format called, \"\"Community Life Radio\"\" where this year WWPC joined CLR along with WRKJ, WMTP and WMEK in addition to the original format referred to as \"\"Word Radio\"\" or \"\"Eighty-eight seven FM\"\", airing on the 24-hour format of radio broadcasting presented by Word Radio via WSEW. Community Life Radio - WRKJ, WMTP, WWPC and WMEK continues to be primarily religious, utilizing, for the most part, national programs produced by Christian program producers and Christian organizations and churches as well as more short features and a bit more contemporary Christian music. The 24-hour format of WSEW continued to be available for streaming on the internet. To reach the spiritual needs of listeners, Biblical instruction continues to be abundant in the form of sermons, dramas and special programming from a variety of speakers and program producers. Many programs aired on all stations are evangelistic in nature, and all programs faithfully present the written Word of God to the listeners of all Word Radio stations. To assist listeners in being informed about the culture and community, listeners have been treated to conservative, Christian world-view talk shows on relevant subjects with opportunities for listeners to call in with comments and/or questions. This has included Point of View Radio Talk Show Monday to Friday afternoons aired live on WSEW 88.7 and by recording on Community Life Radio, In the Market each weekday with Janet Parshall brings current events and many timely topics to the listeners who can also participate by calling on topics of their interest. Midday Connection on CLR stopped production and was replaced by Janet Mefferd Live airing each weekday afternoon bringing relevant topics to the listening audience. Magazine format programs provided relevant spiritual and motivational topics for individuals and families alike, including Dr. James Dobson\\'s Family Talk, Focus on the Family, Haven Today, and Songtime USA. Saturday magazine format programs include Building Relationships with Dr. Gary Smalley , Songtime USA from Cape Cod airing twice daily on both formats, and Breakpoint from the Charles Colson Center. Much to our dismay World Magazine terminated its broadcast format production in favor of a completely on line delivery. We were happy to provide from the American Center for Law and Justice, the Jay Sekulow Live program Monday to Friday. On the weekend, substitute program on Community Life Radio is Up for Debate live from Moody and on WSEW we air the Public Square, a program from the American Policy Roundtable. Short feature national news segments from USA News continue as well as the local host resident of Maine, Tom Zimmerman producing \"\"Straight Talk USA\"\" airing two times a week on Community Life Radio providing to the listeners commentary about happenings in the State of Maine and the nation. Inspirational live hosted music and talk from MBN with \"\"Kurt Goff Live\"\" aired from midnight to 5 AM on Word Radio WSEW, and Community Life as an outreach to the working audience as well as the awake and awakening audience. Late Saturday afternoons and evenings were devoted to music of varying genres, from Christian oldies, to classic oldies, the Pat Boone show, bluegrass, a locally produced daily devotional and music program and contemporary oldies style. Sunday programming included music for varying tastes, such as choral presentations by the National Christian Choir, the classic Sounds of Joy, the Gaither Homecoming and more Christian oldies. CLR aired a greater percentage of locally originated Christian music than WSEW during its broadcast day throughout this year. PROGRAM DELIVERY - We have been able to reduce the number of required daily satellite to digital file recording productions by the increased usage of the AMB-OS delivery system. A second redundant AMB-OS, AMR-100 satellite receiver was acquired for backup delivery purposes to strengthen this very helpful program delivery system. The project for the redundant transmitter operation of WSEW 88.7 FM was completed with all remote power and control functions operable. A standby transmitter is now available to be placed into operation from anywhere in the event of a failure of the main transmitter. WMTP, Conway separate and unique program delivery Studio Transmitter Microwave link equipment has been tested and is now fully operable to support part-time separate programming specifically intended for unique programming appropriate to Mount Washington Valley to be broadcast separate from the normal CLR programming format. COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMMING - Local area hourly weather forecasts and national news broadcasts are provided in the 24/7 format of all stations. A calendar of community events is aired twice daily. It is offered free of charge to other non-profit organizations in the listening areas. Public service announcements rotate through the daily schedule All five stations are active participants in the Emergency Alert System as EAS broadcast outlets and broadcast all regularly required tests and remains technically ready and able to provide all broadcasting services during an actual emergency.

However, the COVID pandemic combined with the hospitalization for cancer of a key staff member forced the ministry to explore new ways to minister online. The President's personal experience over many years of memorizing Scripture passages in both Engish and French, as well as teaching Scripture memorization in ministry meetings, inspired him to create free online courses to teach Scripture memorization in both languages. This was done using the domain names LearnScriptureBy Heart.com and its French counterpart, ApprendreLesEcrituresParCoeur.com to point to the courses on the ministry website.

This delegation was a direct response to the historical and current impacts of colonialism, exclusion, and erasure of indigenous peoples. World Bank Delegation: In 2019, a delegation of 10 young people (ages 18-28) from Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia attended the World Bank Annual Meetings from October 13th - 19th in Washington, D.C. to advocate for climate justice and stand in solidarity with frontline communities in World Bank client countries. UNSG Climate Summit 2019: SustainUS sent a delegation of 10 New York area youth to the UNSG (UN Secretary General) Climate Summit. The Summit was held at the UN Headquarters in New York City during the second week of the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and the delegates mission was to create a robust strategy both in and outside of the Summit walls. The delegation served as the planning group for a local training curriculum, and helped develop demands that connect local campaigns to international policymaking on climate action. In addition to our delegation accomplishments, we conducted several training events and other gatherings for our volunteers. These events prepared our youth for participation in the delegations, and developed teamwork and other essential skills for their success as youth leaders.\",\n",

The Family-Teaching Model of behavioral growth is used throughout the residence programs. The integrated HART model was developed initially at Boys Town and has since been refined and put in place throughout the country. Holy Family has developed and refined the model adding the principles of the Sanctuary program. Each Holy Family staff member receives training in FTSM (Family Teaching & Sanctuary Model) and FTSM Specialists provide additional on-going supervision of FTSM delivery. Through FTSM residents advance to greater levels of self responsibility and receive increased privileges that accompany increased levels of responsibility. Professional services provided to each resident may include:- Individualized Treatment Plans- Psychiatric Evaluation and Treatment- Psychological Evaluation- Individual and Group Psychotherapy- Family Counseling- Experiential Therapies- Educational Services- Nutritional Assessments and Special Dietary Plans- Discharge/Aftercare Coordination In-Home Program Family CounselingThe goal of Holy Family's comprehensive in-home counseling programs in Allegheny, Armstrong, Indiana, and Westmoreland counties in Pennsylvania is to promote and ensure a safe and healthy family home environment. Clinical services develop parental resources by focusing on their strengths and building community ties. By providing services in clients' homes, Holy Family decreases - and in some cases, eliminates - the need to remove a child from his or her family. Trained counselors provide information, support, and assistance to help families overcome addiction, resolve conflicts, find adequate housing, parent their children and build healthy relationships. Outpatient/family focus programOutpatient counseling is designed for clients who are in need of treatment but who also have the skills and support to continue living in the community. Outpatient service provides weekly individual, group and family counseling. Specialty groups provide anger management and relapse prevention aftercare. Outpatient treatment affords clients the ability to continue with jobs and schooling and is tailored to individualized needs. Family Focused Solution Based services provide outpatient counseling to families in their homes. Referred families are involved with either CYF, JPO or Alliance for Infants. Services consist of individual and family counseling to address mental health issues and improve family functioning. Either an adult or child can be the IP, but treatment is focused on the entire family. The goal is to ensure safety of the children in the home and increase functioning of the family in general. In addition, the services provide case management and connection to community resources. Independent Living and Workforce ReadinessA major focus of this program is teaching older youth ages 15-21 independent living skills that can help them achieve success in school, with their families and in work settings. The program focuses on preparation for emancipation. The main objective is to assist the youth with making linkages in the community to which they will be discharged. HFSS recognized the need to provide career awareness and essential vocational and school-to-work programs for youth. We have created and embraced a two-tiered approach. First, we believe that training in a vocational area based on the students' interests, abilities and the local market is essential. Second, we feel that actual work experience, either paid or unpaid on-the-job experiences, combined with related classroom instruction will enhance students' chances for success once they leave the formal educational setting. We believe our approach of both vocational training and work experience will help students choose a career path wisely, prepare them for full-time employment suitable in their abilities and interests and afford them the opportunity to learn to work with others in ways that are successful and rewarding.Duquesne Light Universal ServicesThis is a program in collaboration with the Duquesne Light Company. The program helps eligible low-income families retain or restart Duquesne Light electrical service in their homes. Five offices serve neighborhoods throughout the Pittsburgh region.S.H.O.R.E.S.

Counselors provide clients with support, education and intervention and can address all addiction-related issues, including co-dependency, relationship building, intimacy, and conflict resolution. Services can be provided in home, school, or office settings for eligible clients.Stop Now and Plan (SNAP)SNAP is a proprietary program that teaches preteen boys with behavior problems to respond calmly to stress. School - Based Mentoring Program (SBMP)Launched with a 3 year grant from the US Department of Education, HFSS's mentoring program matches a HFSS resident, in grades 4-8, with an adult volunteer. The goals of the partnership are, through social interaction and academic reinforcement, to improve the residents' interpersonal relationships and his or her schoolwork.Transition to SuccessIn this program young adults who have completed any residential program in Allegheny County receive guidance, support, and referrals as they live independently and pursue education or vocational training.\",\n",

       " \"PREACHING/SPEAKING - An important part of DLM's ministry involves preaching at churches where they are without a full-time pastor, their pastor is on vacation, or is sick. This opportunity allows the president of DLM to encourage people in the church regarding their faith and how they can more effectively live their lives in a way that honors God. This also gives him a chance to interact with people after the service regarding questions they have about what they have been taught. Sometimes the president has been asked to teach an adult class before/after the main service. This affords him an opportunity for a discussion-oriented venue in talking about their Christian faith and what it means to make this practical in their daily lives. SERVICES PROVIDED: The president of DLM has capitalized on many occasions to preach for Sunday morning services. He also has facilitated workshops when the opportunity presents itself. Teaching adult classes on Sunday mornings is often included in serving churches. OBJECTIVES: The president of DLM purposes to accurately teach truth from the Scriptures. Also, the president specifically engages with people regarding questions they have about what they have been taught. The president has interacted with people through workshops, classes, and following Sunday morning services. GOALS: The goal for this preaching/speaking aspect of DLM's ministry is to help people with their relationships, first with God, and secondly, with people. The president of DLM will be available to provide preaching services to other churches in the future. Currently, he is involved in an interim pastorate which significantly affords him the opportunity to meet the goals with people in the church being served.

       " \"General Program Expenses: The Bridge has grown beyond the expectations imagined early on. Over 800 women and children currently receive ministry weekly. The Bridge focuses on 4 key areas, which are: Spiritual Development, Continuing Education, Mental Health Services, and Community Emergency Services. We have seen the beginnings of the movement of God, which gives us the hope and faith to believe for a community and a nation transformed. Emergency Services: The growth of the already mentioned programs heavily relies on Emergency Services. Without basic human needs covered, our vision would be limited and not reach its full potential of impact in the community. The Bridge's solution to this has been a Crisis Care program, which was expanded this year to provide 700 women and their families with groceries through our community food distribution efforts. We also met 184 minor individual emergency needs by offering funding for emergency medical, nutritional, and family needs. These efforts have allowed Haitian leaders to serve the community in a more effective and meaningful way. Spiritual Development: Currently, 720 attend our weekly community Bible studies, where they can come as they are, hear the gospel, and have access to Christian reading material we have published in their native language of Creole. Additionally, 988 Bibles have been distributed to those we serve. The Women's Bible Studies take place weekly, and continued attendance is rooted in the fact that they are accepted, loved, valued, wanted, and cared for by God and our ministry staff. Over the summer, 500 children attended our 6-week long vacation bible school camp. Age-appropriate lessons and activities were prepared to allow them to learn how to read and write. Most importantly, we teach the children about Jesus and the basic foundations of a Christian life. During the school year, we hosted weekly Children's Bible Studies in the community with 73 in attendance. This allowed us to reach out and share hope with children in our community who are not attending school. Another way the Word is spread is through monthly Outreach Events. These events are hosted to provide a comfortable and fun environment for women to get connected with The Bridge, to share the message of the Gospel, a joyful activity, and a meal. There are over 700 in attendance at these events. Our goals for these events are to reach the unreached and continue uplifting and supporting those who are already connected with our ministry. Continuing Education: In becoming connected to the organization, Haitians have the opportunity to receive different levels of education opportunities. The Bridge's School Sponsorship Program provided 30 young women with the possibility to improve their outlook on their future with an education. This program offers life-changing opportunities for the girls and their families and integrates our team into Haitian schools for positive influence and impact. We believe this approach offers great potential to strengthen what Haitians have established in their nation. To be mindful of the students and the program's success, the selection process begins with our Haitian leaders choosing girls from our weekly Bible Studies to attend a Haitian school on a scholarship. Our expectations, requirements, and oversight provide direction for girls to remain in our program, and we connect with their parents, which allows for more ministry. For these parents and other adults connected to The Bridge, Community Adult Literacy Classes and English Classes are provided for them to work on their illiteracy and English proficiency. 125 Haitians weekly benefitted from these adult Continuing Education efforts, which positively contributes to their attractiveness on the job market and, most importantly, their self-image. The literacy classes are held twice weekly for men and women in our community who are illiterate. Each student is provided with materials and lessons to learn how to read and write and as they acquire these life-changing skills, we watch them read the Bible and grow in their faith and relationship with Jesus Christ. English classes are held each week before our Saturday Bible study and serve as a priceless opportunity; in Haiti, if our ladies can speak the. The English language will open many more doors for them. Through these programs, the students gain a level of confidence and self-worth that they have never experienced before.\",\n",
