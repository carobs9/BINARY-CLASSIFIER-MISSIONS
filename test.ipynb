THESE SERVICES ALLOW INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS WHO MAY BE TRANSITION-AGE YOUTH, WORKING-AGE ADULTS OR SENIOR CITIZENS TO CARRY ON THE FUNCTIONS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE THEY DESIRE. PROGRAM SERVICES ARE DELIVERED IN THE CONSUMER'S COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF MAINE ON AN ITINERANT BASIS AND INCLUDE VISION REHABILITATION THERAPY AND COUNSELING IN THE AREA OF ADJUSTMENT TO BLINDNESS. THE VISION REHABILITATION THERAPY COMPONENT ADDRESSES MULTIPLE AREAS OF LEARNING INCLUDING COMMUNICATIONS, ADAPTIVE KITCHEN SKILLS, HOME MANAGEMENT, PERSONAL MANAGEMENT, RECREATION, ORIENTATION AND MOBILITY TRAINING, AND THE USE OF VIDEO MAGNIFICATION EQUIPMENT AND SCREEN READING SOFTWARE AS APPROPRIATE. RESIDENT SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM: THE IRIS NETWORK PROVIDES ONGOING RESIDENT SUPPORT SERVICES TO CERTAIN VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR BLIND RESIDENTS OF IRIS PARK APARTMENTS WHO ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL DISABILITIES. IRIS PARK APARTMENTS FEATURES (30) ONE AND TWO BEDROOM INDEPENDENT LIVING APARTMENTS WHICH ARE SEPARATELY OWNED BUT MANAGED BY THE IRIS NETWORK. VISUALLY IMPAIRED OR BLIND TENANTS WITH MULTIPLE DISABILITIES ARE ABLE TO LIVE AS INDEPENDENTLY AS THEY DESIRE, SCHEDULE THEIR OWN ACTIVITIES, AND CREATE A PERSONAL PLAN FOR ASSISTED LIVING SERVICES. THE IRIS NETWORK OFFERS VISION REHABILITATION THERAPY TO PROVIDE TENANTS SUPPORT IN ALL AREAS OF INDEPENDENT LIVING. THE RESIDENT SUPPORT SERVICES PROGRAM AT IRIS PARK APARTMENTS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE IRIS NETWORK IN THAT THESE SERVICES ARE OFFERED ON AN ONGOING BASIS, RATHER THAN AS INSTRUCTION OR TEACHING DESIGNED TO ALLOW CLIENTS TO LEARN NEW SKILLS AND USE THOSE SKILLS INDEPENDENTLY AFTER SERVICES HAVE BEEN RECEIVED. LOW-VISION CLINIC PROGRAM: THE IRIS NETWORK'S LOW-VISION CLINIC PROVIDES VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS WITH THE SKILLS AND TOOLS TO BETTER UTILIZE THEIR REMAINING VISION. AFTER A LOW-VISION EXAMINATION, AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST OR OPTOMETRIST DEVELOPS A SPECIALIZED TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR EACH CLIENT ADMINISTERED BY AN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST WITH SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN LOW-VISION SERVICES. THE PROGRAM HELPS INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING VISION LOSS TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THEIR REMAINING VISION BY TRAINING EACH CLIENT IN THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO USE OPTICAL AIDS AND EQUIPMENT SUCH AS MAGNIFIERS TO READ THE NEWSPAPER OR LABELS ON PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS, TELESCOPES TO FOCUS ON DISTANT SIGNS, AND LIGHT-FILTERED LENSES TO REDUCE GLARE. ACCESS TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PROGRAM: THE IRIS NETWORK'S ACCESS TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PROGRAM HAS TWO COMPONENTS. IT IS PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO TEACH PEOPLE WHO ARE BLIND OR VISUALLY IMPAIRED TO USE ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS INFORMATION NEEDED TO CARRY OUT THEIR JOBS, OR TO OBTAIN COMPETITIVE EMPLOYMENT. THE ACCESS TECHNOLOGY AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO EMPLOYERS WISHING TO MAKE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO ENABLE EMPLOYEES WITH VISION LOSS TO WORK OR CONTINUE WORKING.

Please see the following excerpt from the Northern Light Health Annual Report 2021 to the Community for details of community benefit projects at NLH members:Community partnershipsTeamworkThe greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members.\"\" - Coretta Scott King These words strongly resonate when we look across our Northern Light Health community. If we measure a community's greatness by the compassionate actions of its members, then we are truly surrounded by greatness and there is much to celebrate. Our culture of caring begins with caring for one another and extends to the care we deliver to people across Maine in the many communities we serve. But if the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that compassion is evident not only in our excellent staff and community members but also in our community partners. Your generosity and innovation have helped extend our reach in living up to our promise to make healthcare work for the people we serve. Our list of community heroes is long, and this Annual Report only features a handful of the people and organizations who have made an important difference during a challenging time. We hope you find these stories as empowering and inspirational as we do.Timothy J. Dentry, MBA President & CEO Northern Light HealthKathy Corey Board ChairNorthern Light HealthA vaccine for everyone AccessOn a sunny July day, a brightly colored RV emblazoned with the faces of children from across the world sits parked outside the Luca Caf in Arundel. The Luca Caf is a quaint seasonal restaurant with Asian-inspired food that has covered outdoor seating and picnic tables. Standing beside some tables and folding chairs in front of the RV, Peggy Akers, RN, and Mary Robbins, RN, two Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses, administer doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to a diverse and willing group of peoplea group which might not have been vaccinated if not for the convenience of this mobile clinic and all the community partners that made it possible. There are populations that we are just not reaching. People who are undocumented, who would feel unsafe coming to a mass vaccination clinic where they might otherwise be asked to present identification or insurance information. We as an organization make it our mission that the only requirements for getting vaccinated are, are you a human being and do you want to be vaccinated? shares Robbins.Their partners for this clinic are Maine Community Action Partners, the New England Arab American Organization, Maine Association for New Americans, Maine Access Immigrant Network (MAIN), and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 Community Support Team. Chanbopha (Chan) Himm is also a member of the support team and co-founder of the Cambodian Community Association and Unified Asian Communities. Her mission is to help get people in underserved populations vaccinated. As some Asian Americans show up, she speaks with them in their native language and offers assurances. She has a welcoming smile and charisma, which seems to make her a natural fit for this kind of work. \"\"They couldn't ask for a better place to get vaccinated,\"\" explains Himm, \"\"because they've got the nurses here that care so much about them. And then they've got their cultural brokersthe ones doing the translations, the community leaders standing right behind them and letting them know that they're going to be okay. What more can someone ask for?\"\" Himm is not just offering lip service when she compliments the Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses doing the clinics. Both Akers and Robbins have been doing this kind of work for a long time with community partners and have earned praise for their compassion and sensitivity. \"\"I feel so lucky in a way to be part of this journey. Doing these vaccines has just been such a gift,\"\" shares Akers.If you would like to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine or get vaccinated, please visit https://covid.northernlighthealth.org/Good health is good businessResiliencyA light summer breeze comes off the Union River as customers gather on picnic tables shaded by umbrellas on the lawn outside the Union River Lobster Pot restaurant in Ellsworth. They are hoisting glasses of cold draft beer as servers carry out plates piled high with steamed clams and boiled lobster garnished with leafy green parsley and lemon wedges. To restaurant owner Brian Langley, the summer of 2021 looks a lot different than the summer of 2020. It's a lot closer to normal, at least in terms of business volume. \"\"We've seen a real influx of customers looking to escape to Maine from wherever they were in the country. They had to get out, and they wanted to go someplace safe. Maine was the epitome of both of those things, says Langley.But as normal as things look, it was a challenge to get here. Like many business owners, Langley was dealing with so many unknowns. How could he keep employees and customers safe from COVID-19? How could he overcome supply chain issues, staffing shortages, social distancing requirements, and government mandates? For these questions and more, Langley turned to Northern Light Health which had started offering business-to-business webinars via the Zoom video conferencing portal. \"\"We call these webinars Good Health is Good Business,\"\" explains Carrie Arsenault, MBA, president of Northern Light Beacon Health, which spearheads the webinar series. \"\"We bring experts together from across Northern Light Health and share resources and advice on how to return to business safely for employees, visitors, and customers.\"\" As a large employer dealing directly with COVID-19, Northern Light Health had the expertise and resources that business owners needed, with experts in infection prevention, supply chain, finance, and behavioral health, to name a few. \"\"One of the reasons you found me every two weeks watching the webinars was to get an idea of what we would be facing, explains Langley. I looked for trusted information, and there you had it from the horse's mouth. You could ask the doctors and other experts direct questions, and if they didn't know something they acknowledged that. It wasn't curated, it was objective and unbiased\"\" Langley explains. A planning group meets regularly to discuss topics, create presentations, and book panelists. James Jarvis, MD, FAAFP, Physician Leader, Incident Command, Northern Light Health, is a frequent panelist because of his expertise in the COVID-19 response. \"\"Initially, I think they just wanted updates on what healthcare was doing and what was going on in our communities in relation to COVID-19. We realized that we needed to be a voice of science and reason to help mitigate fear. There was so much unknown in the beginning part of this pandemic that we felt an obligation to inform our businesses and communities of what we knew and what we thought was going to happen,\"\" explains Dr. Jarvis. Another panelist, Yemaya St. Clair, LCPC, counselor, Northern Light Work Force EAP, was brought in to offer mental health advice to business owners. Many recognized that their employees, and in some cases customers, were struggling to cope with the new normal of the pandemic. \"\"Early on, when the masking mandates went into effect, we provided coaching around de-escalation, to help people stay calm. We also provided resiliency training and ways to help manage stress,\"\" shares St. Clair. For Brian Langley, valuable advice helped him navigate an uncertain time, helped his employees cope, and provided current information to help adapt his business. He used the pandemic as an opportunity to try new menu items and offerings, such as outdoor seating. Eventually, Langley took what he learned and shared it with other business owners as a webinar panelist. \"\"What can I do that's different, and how do I survive? I think that's what I wanted to share,\"\" explains Langley. Arsenault says Northern Light Beacon Health will continue offering the webinars as long as there is a community need. \"\"We are thrilled to be part of the solution to create healthy employees, healthy businesses and, as a result, healthy communities.\"\"Ladders of opportunityPart 1 DiversityWhen Ngozi Christopher, RN, BSN, first started working at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in 2017, she had already worked as a nurse for several years in Nigeria. She had clinical experience and a nursing education but didn't know how steep the cultural curve would be. She remembers one particularly difficult exchange with a patient's wife who was mad at Ngozi because she wouldn't make constant eye contact with her or her husband. \"\"In Nigeria, when you're talking to an elder, you're not supposed to look eye-to-eye because thats a sign of rudeness,\"\" Ngozi explains. She now understands that generally, eye contact is important in western culture. Ngozi was recruited to work at the medical center through Northern Light Health's international nurses' program. She admits that adapting",
