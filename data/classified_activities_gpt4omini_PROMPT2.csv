If we measure a community's greatness by the compassionate actions of its members, then we are truly surrounded by greatness and there is much to celebrate. Our culture of caring begins with caring for one another and extends to the care we deliver to people across Maine in the many communities we serve. But if the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that compassion is evident not only in our excellent staff and community members but also in our community partners. Your generosity and innovation have helped extend our reach in living up to our promise to make healthcare work for the people we serve. Our list of community heroes is long, and this Annual Report only features a handful of the people and organizations who have made an important difference during a challenging time. We hope you find these stories as empowering and inspirational as we do.Timothy J. Dentry, MBA President & CEO Northern Light HealthKathy Corey Board ChairNorthern Light HealthA vaccine for everyone AccessOn a sunny July day, a brightly colored RV emblazoned with the faces of children from across the world sits parked outside the Luca Caf in Arundel. The Luca Caf is a quaint seasonal restaurant with Asian-inspired food that has covered outdoor seating and picnic tables. Standing beside some tables and folding chairs in front of the RV, Peggy Akers, RN, and Mary Robbins, RN, two Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses, administer doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to a diverse and willing group of peoplea group which might not have been vaccinated if not for the convenience of this mobile clinic and all the community partners that made it possible. There are populations that we are just not reaching. People who are undocumented, who would feel unsafe coming to a mass vaccination clinic where they might otherwise be asked to present identification or insurance information. We as an organization make it our mission that the only requirements for getting vaccinated are, are you a human being and do you want to be vaccinated? shares Robbins.Their partners for this clinic are Maine Community Action Partners, the New England Arab American Organization, Maine Association for New Americans, Maine Access Immigrant Network (MAIN), and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 Community Support Team. Chanbopha (Chan) Himm is also a member of the support team and co-founder of the Cambodian Community Association and Unified Asian Communities. Her mission is to help get people in underserved populations vaccinated. As some Asian Americans show up, she speaks with them in their native language and offers assurances. She has a welcoming smile and charisma, which seems to make her a natural fit for this kind of work. """"They couldn't ask for a better place to get vaccinated,"""" explains Himm, """"because they've got the nurses here that care so much about them. And then they've got their cultural brokersthe ones doing the translations, the community leaders standing right behind them and letting them know that they're going to be okay. What more can someone ask for?"""" Himm is not just offering lip service when she compliments the Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses doing the clinics. Both Akers and Robbins have been doing this kind of work for a long time with community partners and have earned praise for their compassion and sensitivity. """"I feel so lucky in a way to be part of this journey. Doing these vaccines has just been such a gift,"""" shares Akers.If you would like to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine or get vaccinated, please visit https://covid.northernlighthealth.org/Good health is good businessResiliencyA light summer breeze comes off the Union River as customers gather on picnic tables shaded by umbrellas on the lawn outside the Union River Lobster Pot restaurant in Ellsworth. They are hoisting glasses of cold draft beer as servers carry out plates piled high with steamed clams and boiled lobster garnished with leafy green parsley and lemon wedges. To restaurant owner Brian Langley, the summer of 2021 looks a lot different than the summer of 2020. It's a lot closer to normal, at least in terms of business volume. """"We've seen a real influx of customers looking to escape to Maine from wherever they were in the country. They had to get out, and they wanted to go someplace safe. Maine was the epitome of both of those things, says Langley.But as normal as things look, it was a challenge to get here. Like many business owners, Langley was dealing with so many unknowns. How could he keep employees and customers safe from COVID-19? How could he overcome supply chain issues, staffing shortages, social distancing requirements, and government mandates? For these questions and more, Langley turned to Northern Light Health which had started offering business-to-business webinars via the Zoom video conferencing portal. """"We call these webinars Good Health is Good Business,"""" explains Carrie Arsenault, MBA, president of Northern Light Beacon Health, which spearheads the webinar series. """"We bring experts together from across Northern Light Health and share resources and advice on how to return to business safely for employees, visitors, and customers."""" As a large employer dealing directly with COVID-19, Northern Light Health had the expertise and resources that business owners needed, with experts in infection prevention, supply chain, finance, and behavioral health, to name a few. """"One of the reasons you found me every two weeks watching the webinars was to get an idea of what we would be facing, explains Langley. I looked for trusted information, and there you had it from the horse's mouth. You could ask the doctors and other experts direct questions, and if they didn't know something they acknowledged that. It wasn't curated, it was objective and unbiased"""" Langley explains. A planning group meets regularly to discuss topics, create presentations, and book panelists. James Jarvis, MD, FAAFP, Physician Leader, Incident Command, Northern Light Health, is a frequent panelist because of his expertise in the COVID-19 response. """"Initially, I think they just wanted updates on what healthcare was doing and what was going on in our communities in relation to COVID-19. We realized that we needed to be a voice of science and reason to help mitigate fear. There was so much unknown in the beginning part of this pandemic that we felt an obligation to inform our businesses and communities of what we knew and what we thought was going to happen,"""" explains Dr. Jarvis. Another panelist, Yemaya St. Clair, LCPC, counselor, Northern Light Work Force EAP, was brought in to offer mental health advice to business owners. Many recognized that their employees, and in some cases customers, were struggling to cope with the new normal of the pandemic. """"Early on, when the masking mandates went into effect, we provided coaching around de-escalation, to help people stay calm. We also provided resiliency training and ways to help manage stress,"""" shares St. Clair. For Brian Langley, valuable advice helped him navigate an uncertain time, helped his employees cope, and provided current information to help adapt his business. He used the pandemic as an opportunity to try new menu items and offerings, such as outdoor seating. Eventually, Langley took what he learned and shared it with other business owners as a webinar panelist. """"What can I do that's different, and how do I survive? I think that's what I wanted to share,"""" explains Langley. Arsenault says Northern Light Beacon Health will continue offering the webinars as long as there is a community need. """"We are thrilled to be part of the solution to create healthy employees, healthy businesses and, as a result, healthy communities.""""Ladders of opportunityPart 1 DiversityWhen Ngozi Christopher, RN, BSN, first started working at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in 2017, she had already worked as a nurse for several years in Nigeria. She had clinical experience and a nursing education but didn't know how steep the cultural curve would be. She remembers one particularly difficult exchange with a patient's wife who was mad at Ngozi because she wouldn't make constant eye contact with her or her husband. """"In Nigeria, when you're talking to an elder, you're not supposed to look eye-to-eye because thats a sign of rudeness,"""" Ngozi explains.

"Early Childhood Education - ECE is one of the staples of the modern YMCA. Although this program is a sizeable portion of our revenue, it concurrently is the largest component of our expenses, too - especially SBT. With all ratio based care, the more participants you can put into a room, the better. With ECE, the ratios of care for """"staff:children"""" are Infant 2:8, Older Infant 2:9, Toddler 2:10, Preschool 2:14, and PreK 2:20. To help offset revenue loss in the Infant through Toddler rooms, our strategy has been to partner with other organizations to provide services at locations other than the YMCA. This strategy has worked successfully at Temple Shalom, a Jewish Synagogue, and we are looking forward to opening a new center in Rumford in 2025. Fitness and Wellness - Fitness and Wellness programming at the YMCA of Auburn-Lewiston is mostly accomplished through membership subscription to the Y's three (3) local fitness centers: Y@Turner Street in Auburn, Y@CMMC in Lewiston, and Y@HCS in Lewiston. While yoga, group exercise, cycling classes and other programs are included in membership benefits, there are also premium programs that are fee-for-service, such as personal training, nutrition counseling, and chronic condition coaching to name a few. With the purchase of the Health Club and Spa, Fitness & Membership also includes aquatics programming, such as free swim, classes, and use of hot tub and sauna. Youth Development - Youth Development has three major components: Before and After School, Y Day & Kids Camp, and Youth Sports. All of these components serve kiddos in the primary age range of 5 to 12 years old, but youth sports, such as swimming and gymnastics, may include youth up to 18 years old. When appropriate, transportation to and from school or camp is provided by the YMCA. The unique part of youth development programming is none of the three components goes year around. This makes them complimentary in a sense yet require extra staffing during programming because of the difficulty of finding staff who have all the required skills, abilities, knowledge, and experience. Due to growth potential and community needs in these areas, we will launch a capital campaign to do major renovations to the Y's Outdoor Learning and Education Center in 2024/2025.",0,"The summary focuses on early childhood education, fitness, and youth development programs without any mention of religious or faith-based activities."

"Operation of a contemporary museum located in the heart of downtown Bar Harbor, Maine focusing on the understanding and appreciation of the State of Maine's Native American heritage, culture, history, and archaeology. The Museum's collections, exhibitions, and programs focus on Native American traditions in Maine and explore the broader Native American experience, past and present. The history and cultures of Maine's Native American people, the Wabanaki, are showcased through changing exhibitions, special events, collection management, teacher workshops, archaeology field schools, and craft workshops for children and adults. Visitors find dynamic and stimulating exhibitions and activities interspersed with spaces for quiet reflection. In addition to the downtown location, from spring through fall, the Abbe's historic trailside museum at Sieur de Mont's Spring continues to offer visitors a step back in time to the early 20th century presentations of Native American archaeology in Maine.Admissions:The Museum had over 25,000 visits combined at our two locations. Visitors come from most of the USA plus many foreign countries.Curatorial Services:The Museum serves as one of the only two federally recognized repositories of archaeological artifacts in the State of Maine. In addition, the Museum houses an extensive collection of historic and contemporary Native American artwork and crafts which, in part, forms the basis for public exhibitions that highlight Native American culture.Education:The Museum provided educational progams to schools throughout Maine both on site and in the classroom. School programs address topics of archaeology, culture differences, trade economies, and stereotyping. The Museum provides a teacher training workshop, workshops and demonstrations for adults and children, and is an essential resource for helping teachers and students comply with new state legislation known as """"the Wabanaki Initiative."""" The Museum also provides educational opportunities for adults and children visiting Acadia National Park.Memberships:The Museum offers several levels of membership. Each level offers certain benefits. Some of the benefits are unlimited free admission, invitations to events, and newsletters. Stitching Ourselves Together ExhibitThis year saw the development of our newest exhibit, Stitching Ourselves Together, a collaboration between Wabanaki community members and the Museum. It is presented from a first-person perspective, with Mi'kmaq artisans and culture keepers sharing their experiences working with quills. Community curator Jennifer Pictou (Mi'kmaq) explains, """"When we, as Mi'kmaq people, are involved in the curation and narration of our own history we are able to correct the incomplete and often erroneous narratives assigned to our existence. Academics have often misidentified the motifs represented in our quill art or applied their own experiences and beliefs to our imagery. This Euro-centric interpretation negates our Indigenous use of symbols, styles, and patterns."""" Stitching Ourselves Together challenges common misconceptions around this traditional art form. The displays include historical and contemporary pieces from skilled Mi'kmaq quillworkers and artist profiles from the """"Quillers of the Dawn"""" group working to revive the art form. Alongside this exhibit we also presented our long running Waponahki Student Art Show, which showcases the works of students from the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Passamaquoddy Tribe at Motahkomikuk (Indian Township) and Sipayik (Pleasant Point), Mi'kmaq Nation, and Penobscot Nation at Panuwapskek (Indian Island). Digital AMIM The importance of creative placemaking and how it supports Wabanaki artists, and the local community, led us to create The Abbe Museum Indian Market in 2018. Over 50 Tribal artisans from across North America, representing over 30 Indigenous Nations, attended in its inaugural year. At the onset of COVID, the Museum was ready to host over 75 artists on the Village Green and quickly had to pivot to a digital format, creating the first Digital Abbe Museum Indian Market (AMIM). With this format, we created a digital platform for artist engagement that included online profiles for collectors to connect with artisans, a 6 hours live event with performances, discussions, and storytelling, a virtual competition, and a film screening. This year's Digital AMIM expanded on the format maintaining all of the elements of the original event while also adding a new evening Preview Party with performances from Wabanaki artists Firefly (Penobscot) and Jennifer Pictou (Mi'kmaq).",0,"The summary focuses on the operation of a museum dedicated to Native American heritage and culture, without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

NorthStar quickly acquired ambulances for the Pen Bay and Waldo fleet in late 2022 and then set out to hire 29 full-time and per diem paramedics and emergency medical technicians.The new team completed its first inter-facility transport in February 2023. Since then, it has completed more than 500 transports, and the percentage of patients waiting more than three hours for a transfer out of the ED has reduced by 25%. Teaching (Medical and Interprofessional Education Program)Educating and training healthcare professionals is vital to MaineHealth's mission. This is a critical component to the delivery of quality health care and developing the health care workforce. To that end we have established a number of robust training and education programs. MaineHealth's flagship hospital, Maine Medical Center (MMC), has a long history of educating medical students, residents, interprofessional providers and faculty. (Continued on Schedule O)(Continued from page 2 of 990, Line 4b) The Department of Medical Education, with a staff of 80, manages multiple educational programs and resources. Education programs span undergraduate medical education, graduate medical education, and interprofessional provider education. In undergraduate medical education, the Tufts University School of Medicine (TUSM) - Maine Medical Center Program, known as the """"Maine Track,"""" was established in 2008 and offers a unique and innovative curriculum, exposing students to rural practices and training in a major tertiary medical center. There are 40 matriculants in each TUSM class dedicated to the Maine Track. Much of the curriculum is based in Maine, particularly in the 2nd through 4th years of medical school. MMC developed a unique 9-month Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship offered at MMC and in 10 community hospital sites. 81 graduates of the Maine Track who have completed their residency programs are working in Maine as of 2023. Additionally, clerkship students from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine rotate through MMC and MaineHealth sites annually. In graduate medical education, MMC has 15 residency programs, 3 rural residency tracks and 15 fellowships, all approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Currently there are approximately 320 physician residents and fellows. Historically, about one-third of MMC's residency graduates have stayed in Maine to practice. Our graduates also go on to outstanding fellowship programs. In addition to physician postgraduate education, MMC and Tufts University School of Dental Medicine sponsor an Advanced Education in General Dentistry residency program. In addition, MMC established a critical care advanced practice provider residency program in 2021.The Hannaford Center for Safety, Innovation and Simulation is a state-of-the-art 15,000 square-foot training center that utilizes the latest in human medical simulator technology to take medical education to the highest level possible. The center provides learners and faculty with extremely realistic scenarios, allowing them to gain significant skills while greatly reducing patient risk and supports learners and clinicians across MaineHealth. MaineHealth/MMC is the flagship provider for Continuing Interprofessional Development (CIPD) in Maine, and is jointly accredited through the major national accrediting bodies including medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and others. The goal of the CIPD program is to provide continuing education of the highest quality for all professions within the state. Launched in 2015, the MaineHealth Institute for Teaching Excellence (MITE) provides faculty development opportunities (e.g., Scholars program) for educators. In addition to offering certificate programs, support for medical education research and a wide variety of high-quality educational opportunities, the Institute hosts a varied menu of high-quality faculty development. By promoting academic medicine excellence at all levels of interprofessional education, the Institute and the MITE Academy (component of MITE) seek to support, nurture and promote all clinician educators in the State of Maine. Significant FY 2023 accomplishments include: Undergraduate Medical Education:-Thirteen of the TUSM-Maine Track medical students who graduated in 2023 remained in Maine to complete their residency of whom 12 will remain at MMC.-Completed an initial grant and received a second grant from the Association of American Medical Colleges and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop the project, """"Interprofessional Education and Collaborative Learning: A Novel Training Tool for Addressing COVID-19 Health Misinformation"""" in which training videos are developed to support clinicians in learning how to discuss misinformation with patients and colleagues.Graduate Medical Education:-Four new academic tracks were developed and will be launched in Spring 2024. The four tracks are: Clinician-Educator and Leadership Track (CELT) for Residents, CELT for Fellows, Research Track for Residents, and Clinical Informatics Track Residents and Fellows.-MMC Graduate Medical Education (GME) was the founding grant member of the new state-wide Maine Rural GME Education (MERGE) Collaborative, funded by the State of Maine, to increase the number of rural GME electives across the State and create a de novo learning platform, the """"Interprofessional Healthcare Learning Platform"""" (iHELP-Maine), focused on rural and underserved learning resources for all interprofessional healthcare students and faculty across the state. Eleven (11) of the 23 new rural training sites are at MaineHealth hospitals.Advanced Practice Provider Residency Program:The Advanced Practice Provider Critical Care Residency program (APP) was initiated in October 2021 with two APP residents. In 2023 the class expanded to four and it became the first accredited APP residency in Maine and the 10th in the nation to be accredited with the Advanced Practice Provider Fellowship Association (APPFA) through the American Nurses Credentialing Center.Simulation:-The simulation team collaborated with MaineHealth Nursing Academic Affairs and Workforce Development to develop a simulation instructor course for nursing workforce development in which the simulation center hosted nurse educators from MaineHealth and Southern Maine Community College. This one-day simulation instructor course is designed to support strategic partnerships with undergraduate nurse training programs.-The simulation center successfully disseminated the neonatal resuscitation program simulation training across all MaineHealth hospitals, including affiliate member Maine General Hospital, including system-wide analysis of safety findings. -The simulation center conducted more than 603 events for more than 5,100 learners in FY 23. Interprofessional Education:-359 Joint Accredited Interprofessional Education activities were conducted in CloudCME in FY23. -Joint Accreditation (JA) supports """"planning by the team, for the team"""". The percent of interprofessional educational activities has increased from a little over 25% when we were granted JA status in 2020 to 73% in 2023. -The MaineHealth Institute for Teaching Excellence (MITE) supports an interprofessional Academy of Educators who have dedicated a part of their professional career to health professions education. The number of Academy members has steadily grown since its inception in 2016, with now over 90 members.Health Professions Education:-MaineHealth received a Health Equity Grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services for the Building-ME Network project. Its purpose is to increase healthcare workforce in training opportunities in rural and underserved areas for all healthcare disciplines by creating a statewide system to streamline clinical placements for trainees and preceptors in rural communities. ResearchResearch is a core component of the MaineHealth mission and essential to the delivery of quality health care in the future. MaineHealth Institute for Research (MHIR) is the research arm of MaineHealth. MHIR supports and encourages a broad spectrum of research, ranging from basic laboratory-based research to translational and clinical research, to health services, population, and community-engaged research. The institute has four scientific centers: the Center for Applied Science & Technology, the Center for Clinical & Translational Science, (Continued on Schedule O)(Continued from page 2 of 990, Line 4c) the Center for Interdisciplinary Population & Health Research, and the Center for Molecular Medicine. In 2023, MHIR had $25.6M in grant funding and received 29 new grants, allowing the institute's clinical and biomedical researchers to contribute to nationally and internationally-recognized scientific research. In addition, over 250 clinical trial studies took place with the top areas of focus in Oncology, Neurology, and Cardiology. Notably in 2023, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a five-year, $12.9 million research grant renewing the institute's Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) in Metabolic Networks. The funding will advance research infrastructure for the study of metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis and lipid and energy imbalances. In 2023, MHIR investigators and physician scientists continued to address COVID with a number of important research efforts including a NIH funded national effort to examine whether the virus that causes COVID remains hidden in the fat tissue of patients with Long COVID, stressing their immune systems to the point of potential failure. The study is part of the nationwide RECOVER (Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery) initiative that seeks to understand, prevent and find treatments for Long COVID; investigators from MHIR are among those at more than 70 institutions across the country participating in RECOVER. Other 2023 highlights included: 159 scientific articles published and over 1,499 biospecimens were distributed by the institute's BioBank Tissue Repository.",0,The summary focuses entirely on healthcare services and medical education without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts.

"EDUCATION: Education is the cornerstone of individual and community success. It is essential to getting and keeping a job with a livable wage and health benefits. It is also fundamental to a community's economic prosperity: a well-educated workforce attracts world-class jobs. United Way funds 25 programs at 13 partner agencies that focus on education, helping us advance our overall education goal of improving graduation rates in Cumberland County. From addressing youth self-esteem to funding accredited child care centers, United Way is helping children, youth, and families reach their potential.Just as the strength of the foundation determines the stability of the home, all future learning, behavior, and health is based on one's early experiences. Our vision is that young people will grow up healthy and ready for the future; that they are prepared for kindergarten; that children are reading on grade level by fourth grade; that middle school youth are at grade level in math and reading; and that high school students graduate with proficiency and ready for college, the workplace, or the military. Research and experience show that each one of these benchmarks is essential for long term success.In addition to funding our partner agency programs, we have a number of place-based initiatives that allow us to conduct intensive, targeted work in the identified communities. Most of our partner agencies are involved in one or more of the projects outlined below, which strengthens the impact of our investments and community partnerships: 1. The Westbrook Children's Project continues to be an example of how we are working to fulfill our vision. This year the Children's Project expanded in scope, identifying a range of goals and strategies to support the success of youth in Westbrook from cradle to career. Active and focused partnerships amongst the Westbrook School Department and community partners have grown through increased staffing capacity commitment from United Way of Greater Portland.Important Project strategies in FY 2013 included:- Development and implementation of an early warning system throughout the school district to identify at-risk students and proactively plan for school and community interventions.- School and community partnerships to collect and analyze school department data to identify areas of strength and challenges with the goal of aligning resources to increase student achievement district-wide.- Development of a plan for increasing early kindergarten screening and the integration of consistent screening tools utilizing nationally identified best practices. Additional Project Accomplishments in the past year include:- Through coordination and alignment of resources, a community-wide summer reading initiative challenged children, families, teachers, and community members to engage in literacy activities to address summer slide. School department data indicates more children maintained levels of academic progress over the 2013 summer.- Through early screenings, at-risk incoming kindergarten students were identified and encouraged to enroll in a summer Jump Start program. Of those children attending this program, all showed progress in letter identification, sound identification or both, and 82% met the fall kindergarten benchmark in letter sounds, important indicators of future academic success.- With the support of the Children's Project, 228 volunteers donated over 3,500 hours to help children succeed across three elementary schools.2. Portland ConnectED is a cradle-to-career initiative intended to coordinate efforts, align resources, and harness the expertise of local and national organizations and leaders to prepare citizens to meet the challenges of the future. Portland ConnectED's initial efforts and resources are focused on the goals of kindergarten readiness, grade-level reading proficiency by third grade, high school graduation, and post-secondary enrollment, persistence, and completion. United Way coordinates the efforts of Starting Strong, the subcommittee of Portland ConnectED focused on school readiness and grade-level reading proficiency. Throughout 2013, the Starting Strong subcommittee developed a Community Solutions Action Plan, informed by the Campaign for Grade Level Reading, focused on improving school readiness, reducing chronic absence, and reducing summer learning loss.3. Count ME In is an innovative partnership of schools, parents, youth, and community organizations. The goal of Count ME In is to improve elementary school attendance by increasing the capacity of school staff, community-based organizations, businesses, and families to address chronic absenteeism. Count ME In seeks to decrease the number of students with chronic absenteeism in Cumberland County elementary schools by 50% by 2018. FY2013 is the pilot year for the project. Five participating districts have reviewed and revised their district attendance policies, developed teams to monitor attendance data and convened multi-stakeholder teams to create interventions for those students at-risk of chronic absence. The Count ME In leadership is working on a statewide level to improve the way that students are flagged as at-risk in the school data management system, as well as producing a toolkit for the Count ME In model which will allow for replication of the project in additional school districts.4. South Portland Partners for Student Success (SPPSS) is a collaboration of the South Portland School District and community-based organizations that have come together to provide integrated support for children who are at-risk of getting off track and their families. The goal of the project is to develop an Early Warning System that uses data to recognize when a student is in need of additional support and to implement said support in a timely fashion.In the pilot year, the partners have identified a cohort of elementary school students, all of whom were chronically absent in 2012-2013, on which to focus. Concentrating on this small group of students will allow the partners to develop an effective system that integrates school and community interventions, with the intent to scale this beyond the pilot group in the coming years. At present, the partners have developed a joint release for student information, hosted two training events for school and community partners, and started outreach to the students' families.5. United Way provides fiscal management and funding to the Early Childhood Funders Group, a statewide consortium of foundations and other organizations that provide funding for early learning in the state of Maine. The group meets quarterly to discuss issues related to early learning and to determine how the combined resources and influence of the group can have the greatest impact.6. In partnership with the Sam L. Cohen and John T. Gorman Foundations, United Way supports a mini-grants program at Maine Roads to Quality. Mini-grants are given to childcare centers an effort to improve their step on the statewide program quality scale. HEALTH: Improving people's physical and mental well-being is one of the building blocks of a thriving community; however, numerous obstacles stand in the way of good health for many residents of Greater Portland. United Way funds 43 programs at 21 partner agencies that focus on health, helping us advance our health goals in the community. From addressing substance abuse to funding vision rehabilitation programs and outpatient mental health clinical services, United Way works tirelessly to improve life for thousands of residents in Greater Portland.In collaboration with several community partners, United Way developed the Let's Go! program. Let's Go! is a nationally-recognized, community-based childhood obesity prevention program that promotes healthy lifestyles for children, youth, and their families. The goal is to increase physical activity and healthy eating, reversing trends regarding youth obesity. We accomplish our goals using the 5-2-1-0 message: eat at least 5 fruits and vegetables per day; limit recreational screen time (TV or computer use) to 2 hours or less; get 1 hour or more of physical activity every day; and drink 0 sugar-sweetened beverages, choosing low fat milk or water instead of soda. This message is used consistently across the multi-sector model to reinforce environmental and policy change strategies. Let's Go!'s statewide efforts are now managed by Barbara Bush Children's Hospital at Maine Medical Center. United Way continues to provide key leadership in the statewide project and financially supports the work in Cumberland County by funding two full-time coordinators to implement the multi-sector model locally. In FY13, Let's Go! Dissemination Partners in Cumberland County reached 62,143 youth through their work with 40 schools, 52 early childhood sites, 24 afterschool sites and 25 health care sites. Let's Go! also recognizes sites in all sectors based on how many of the priority strategies are being implemented and written into policy (and enforced). In Cumberland County, Let's Go! Greater Portland recognized 9 schools, 15 childcare sites, 14 health care sites, and 12 afterschool centers. This was an increase from the 34 sites recognized the prior year.Statewide evaluation data shows that schools, afterschools, and early childhood programs are implementing and sustaining strategies that increase healthy eating and physical activity. Locally, 93% of child care programs rarely use food as a reward, 78% of schools provide opportunities for physical activity, 100% of afterschool sites limit sugary beverages, and 100% of registered health care practices display the Let's Go! poster and routinely determine BMI for all patients over the age of two. FINANCIAL STABILITY: Many people in Greater Portland do not have a stable income that allows them to provide the basics- food, housing, and utilities. United Way has always taken a strategic approach to addressing critical issues, and financial stability is no exception. Financial stability comes from providing families with the resources and opportunities they need to meet their basic needs. United Way funds 14 programs at 9 partner agencies that focus on income and securing the basics, helping us advance our financial stability goals in the community. From addressing the needs of refugees and immigrants to transportation and legal services programs, United Way is linking community members to tools that will help them get on, or continue down, the path to financial stability.1. CA$H (Creating Assets, Savings, and Hope) Greater Portland is a partnership of community leaders and industry experts empowering individuals and families to achieve long-term financial stability. CA$H is a year-round resource for the community, offering free income tax preparation to qualified filers during tax season, helping employers bring financial education tools to their employees, and educating hard-working residents about how they can make the most of their money. CA$H connects the community to local programs and services, and utilizes its website, www.cashgp.org, as a financial education clearinghouse. In 2013, CA$H free income tax preparation events returned $1,488,146 in federal and state tax refunds to the community, and applied for $418,246 in federal earned income tax credits.2. United Way of Greater Portland serves as the Cumberland County Local Board administrator for the federal Emergency Food and Shelter National Board Program (EFSP). This program is designed to help communities respond to local emergency food and shelter needs. EFSP funds are intended to help local existing programs, such as food pantries and shelters, expand their capacity to serve those in need. Local funding decisions are made by the Local Board which sets priorities, advertises the availability of funds, makes funding recommendations, and provides technical support to recipient organizations throughout the grant period. EFSP's Phase 30 (April 1, 2012 through July 31, 2013) funding awarded 21 Cumberland County agencies grants totaling $93,005.3. United Way of Greater Portland convenes the Cumberland County Food Security Council, a coalition focused on increasing access to food for vulnerable populations throughout Cumberland County. Formed in 2011, the council is comprised of representatives from local businesses, farms, food pantries and meal providers, government agencies, and other social services providers. The Council has been engaged in a strategic planning process to determine priorities.The Council's focus includes developing a food security information infrastructure in Cumberland County to drive evidence-based strategic initiatives. This includes Listserv and a common database to collect and share data, which is in development. This effort involves building collaboration and consensus among the key food providers for the county, as well as the front-line pantries and meal programs served by them. The establishment of a common data collection tool and information infrastructure will help provide an accurate picture of the state of food security in the county and provide strategic direction to hunger reduction efforts, provide a formal mechanism for collaboration, communication, and data sharing among key food providers and help reduce the burden of duplicative data reporting on the part of front line providers. The Council's other major focus was to utilize a community conversation model in the Lakes Region of Cumberland County, to bring together partners from across the food system to identify and discuss the food access issue and potential solutions for particular communities and across many communities. A successful series of conversations in the Lakes Region was completed in the fall of 2012. It resulted in new relationships between providers and local government and the establishment of subcommittees to develop work plans related to three key strategies identified through the conversations: 1. Cooperative Buying and Resource Development, 2. Education and Prevention, and 3. Data Collection and Advocacy.4. United Way of Greater Portland's CEO served as one of the Tri-Chairs of the Homelessness Prevention Task Force. The task force was established by Council Order in November of 2011 and asked to review and gain an understanding of the causal factors associated with homelessness, as well as the current community resources available to meet the unique needs of individuals experiencing homelessness in order to develop a multi-year strategic plan, including measurable objectives to reduce, prevent, and end homelessness in Greater Portland. The City Council adopted the Task Force's report in November 2012, and various organizations are now working on implementation. 1. 2-1-1 Maine is a partnership with the United Ways of Maine, The Opportunity Alliance, and the State of Maine that connects people to resources such as heating and utilities assistance, access to food pantries, housing and shelter, and mental health services through a toll-free telephone number (211) and a robust online directory at 211Maine.org. Call specialists assess callers' needs and refer them to help 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, utilizing a statewide database of 8,000 resources. Last year, 2-1-1 Maine call specialists answered over 78,000 calls, providing information and referral services.2. Keep ME Warm is a statewide partnership of the 10 United Ways in Maine and the 10 Community Action Agencies (CAPs) to raise funds to supplement fuel assistance programs in Maine. Keep ME Warm is the only statewide fuel assistance fundraising effort in the state. United Way of Greater Portland is the custodian of the Keep ME Warm Fund and is responsible for collecting, distributing, and reporting. Funds contributed to Keep ME Warm are distributed based on a formula developed by the CAPs and United Ways in Maine based on federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) distribution percentages as well as population. CAPs receive 65% of the funds, United Ways receive 25%, and 10% is used to fund emergency overnight assistance though 2-1-1 Maine.Donations to Keep ME Warm provide emergency heating assistance. CAPs use the funds to help households that might not be eligible for limited federal, state, or local fuel assistance programs. United Way funds support additional organizations and agencies in their communities that can help those in need of fuel assistance. 2-1-1 Maine aids in the distribution of funds for statewide overnight emergency fuel assistance for people who have no heat and have children or elderly family members in their household.More than $225,000 was raised for heating assistance through Keep ME Warm last year.3. Designations are donor-directed contributions to health and human service organizations. Donors to United Way's campaign may direct all or a portion of their contribution to specific nonprofit agencies that provide health and human services. Each agency's nonprofit 501(c)(3) status and compliance with the USA Patriot Act is verified before funds are distributed.4. Additional expenses are incurred by the Organization to assess community needs and to lead and participate in community partnerships and advocacy to advance our education, financial stability, and health goals. In addition, these expenses support outcome measurement training and assistance to agencies, assist and promote agency collaboration and mergers, support program reviews and selection of program/agency recipients, help solicit and administer grants, and support financial and programmatic oversight.5. United Way administers various grant programs to promote diversity and inclusion, assist people in need, and assess and promote nonprofit collaboration, as well as scholarship programs for minority youth and students in the Greater Portland area.6. Volunteers play a vital role in improving people's lives and reaching our goals in education, financial stability, and health. To this end, United Way works with agencies and corporate partners to secure qualified volunteers and works with volunteers to locate appropriate volunteer opportunities. Through a collaborative effort, United Way offers a statewide, searchable listing of volunteer opportunities at www.volunteermaine.org. This valuable tool allows agencies to post volunteer opportunities and individuals to perform a customized search. In addition to hosting and administering the site, we offer technical support to volunteers and agencies on how to use it. Additionally, United Way organizes a variety of community events including an annual food drive, National Family Volunteer Day, National Mentoring Month, Literacy Kits for Kids project and dozens of tailor-made volunteer projects for corporate partners. One of the largest and best-attended events each year is our Day of Caring, at which nearly 1,000 volunteers dedicate more than 5,000 hours of service to 75 projects at more than 50 different sites.",0,"The summary focuses on education, health, and financial stability initiatives without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"Patient Care - PAMC provided inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Services of quality medical healthcare were provided regardless of race, creed, sex, national origin, handicap, age, or ability to pay although reimbursement for services rendered is critical to the operation and financial stability of PAMC. It is recognized that not all individuals possess the ability to purchase essential medical services. It is further recognized that our mission is to serve the community with respect to providing healthcare services and healthcare education. Emergency Care - A significant amount of free care is provided through the medical center's 24-hour a day emergency department. Emergency medical care is provided to every patient entering the emergency department, even though they may be unable to make payment for the services. Community Care - In keeping with PAMC's commitment to serve all members of its community, the medical center also provided a wide range of activities which included wellness programs, community education programs, and special programs for the elderly, handicapped or medically under-served, along with a variety of broad based community support programs. Most of these programs are offered for the cost of materials and professional services only, or at no fee at all as a community service. PAMC's wellness department reflects the shift in healthcare focus from treatment to prevention. The concept of wellness is to make sick people well and to keep well people from getting sick. Research is proving that exercise and proper diet can help reverse many chronic diseases and reduce the use of medication in many illnesses. Health talks have been given to schools, industries, social and civic groups. Health information, counseling, and audiovisuals have been provided to the community. Rarkview has an active volunteer program. Volunteers give many hours toward the common pupose of meeting the healthcare needs of the community. The value of the program is given back to the community through lower costs for patient services and health education.",0,The summary focuses on healthcare services and community support without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts.

"Please see the following excerpt from the Northern Light Health Annual Report 2020 to the Community for details of community benefit projects at NLH members:HEROES AMONG US Healthcare Heroes As we reflect on 2020, people around the world would do well to remember these words by Nelson Mandela, Do not judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again. We faced a global pandemic that took the lives of more than 500,000 of our fellow Americans and more than 2.5 million people worldwide and counting. We also faced deadly wildfires and hurricanes, racial unrest, and a country divided by politics. But during this turbulent time, we also saw the very best in people, including those whom we work alongside every day to deliver compassionate healthcare to the people of Maine. We saw our colleagues rise to the challenges of an unprecedented global pandemic, show courage in the face of adversity, and make selfless sacrifices to heal the sick and protect our communities. These people are heroes. They are the front line workers who provided direct patient care to those who became infected with coronavirus. They are also the people who worked behind the scenes to ensure our staff had the personal protective equipment and telehealth technology they needed to continue to provide care safely. They are the support staff that cleaned and disinfected rooms, prepared meals, and countless other tasks to support our direct care workers. In this years annual report, we celebrate these heroes. They may not have flashy costumes or superpowers like the comic book heroes or those in Hollywood films. But like those heroes, they must don masks as they face a genuine and dangerous enemy. In the pages of this years annual report, you will learn more about who they are and what they do. We will take you behind their masks to discover the true identity of the heroes among us. Timothy J. Dentry, MBA President & CEO Kathy Corey Northern Light Health, Board Chair HEROES ON THE FRONT LINES When it comes to caring for sick patients, Northern Light Healths front line staff put themselves at risk to provide exceptional care. We know they are brave and compassionate people, but COVID-19 has shown how far they are willing to go to help others. The following are a few of the many examples of courage and caring that we witnessed during this global pandemic. Cathy Bean, RNManager of Clinical and Community Health Services Northern Light Home Care & Hospice In late March, Portland saw a spike in the population of homeless people who were getting sick with COVID-19. To help protect the citys homeless residents, city leaders immediately opened the Portland Expo as an alternative shelter site that would allow them to maintain their shelter capacity while adhering to the Centers for Disease Controls (CDC) social distancing guidelines. But how would they separate the healthy population from those with the virus? Cathy Bean, RN stepped up to help. Donning protective gear, she and her staff went into the shelters daily to screen and test the residents. Northern Light Home Care & Hospice also equipped the city of Portland with a telehealth system so home care nurses could provide follow up appointments. As a result, they were able to help shelter residents with other medical conditions that may have been missed. Many of these people, due to COVID-19, were in quarantine, and meals brought outside their door with no one able to check on them. Now, we could get in there and take care of these people, and thats been very rewarding. Cathy Bean, RNElizabeth Bigler, RN Emergency Department Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital Elizabeth Bigler, RN thinks the most significant change to her job since COVID-19 is how much more physically exhausting it has become. She must often wear respirators, hoods, and other personal protective equipment, which can get quite hot and stuffy during a shift in the Emergency Department. Her biggest concern is making sure she doesnt bring this virus into her home. Its why she enters through a basement door, places her clothing directly into the wash, and showers before interacting with her family. My daughter who is eight is a sensitive, insightful soul. And shes had a lot of fears about me getting sick, not being able to see me if I did get sick, or me not coming home. Her daughter wrote her a touching letter one morning, telling her to be safe and that she loved her. Shes a really strong little girl. I had to tell her that this is a community effort. I cant not go because its scary. Some people still need help, and our job as community members is to help them. Elizabeth Bigler, RNJames Jarvis, MDSenior Physician ExecutiveIncident Command, Northern Light Health When Northern Light Health knew COVID-19 would arrive in Maine, James Jarvis, MD was chosen to coordinate the systems response among its member hospitals in addition to coordinating with state and local governments and the other major healthcare systems in Maine. Another unexpected role that Dr. Jarvis fulfilled during the pandemic was to be the primary spokesperson for Northern Light Health for weekly statewide news conferences via Zoom. Several times a week he would convey critical information to members of the media and our communities. One of the pleasant surprises Ive had during this time was somebody randomly driving by, lowering their window, and saying, Dr. Jarvis, how are you doing? You always ask how were doing through TV, we want to make sure youre okay. I teared up a little because, sure its neat to be recognized, but it was that sense of community that Mainers have to say, we need to make sure youre okay because we appreciate what youre doing. James Jarvis, MDCaroline Joyce, PACNorthern Light Primary Care Northern Light CA Dean Hospital Caroline Joyce loves the outdoors and dreams of retiring in a small rural community where hiking, fishing, and camping abound. She and her husband built their retirement home in Greenville, and she took a job at Northern Light CA Dean Hospital in September of 2019. Little did she realize how good her timing was to move to a rural community before the outbreak of COVID-19. As a primary and acute care provider, she willingly staffed the drive-up screening tent outside CA Dean. She endured wind and rain and snow to screen patients. And, she did all this while her mother, living in a nursing home in another state, was diagnosed with COVID-19. Luckily, my mom experienced mild symptoms, and while I wanted to see her, she was in an area of Massachusetts that was really hit hard by the coronavirus, and I was here seeing patients. I couldnt risk exposing them or my family. Caroline Joyce, PACSue-Anne Hammond, DOMedical Director of Primary CareNorthern Light Mercy Hospital For Dr. Hammond, COVID-19 became personal very quickly as one of her long-time patients, with whom shed experienced many ups and downs, was among the first in Maine to die of the deadly coronavirus. It was a curve ball, and it felt so unfair, she said. Dr. Hammond was instrumental in setting up the COVID-19 response plan for Northern Light Mercy Hospital, which became a model shared with other Northern Light Health hospitals across the state. The drive-up swab and go tent at Mercys Fore River campus allowed people to safely and easily get tested for the coronavirus. The plan also included a respiratory tent site in Westbrook to assess whether people with symptoms needed to be admitted to the emergency department or sent home with care instructions. And it included a virtual clinic to keep patients out of hospital and primary care settings through telehealth for follow-up appointments. She worked seven days a week while her children were being schooled at home. She and her husband, also a front line provider, tried to allay their familys fears and correct misinformation in their communities. On the hardest days I still love what I do. I dont feel like Im a hero; Im doing what was asked of me and what I chose to do as a doctor. This is a hard time, but I dont think I want to be anywhere else in the middle of all of this. Sue-Anne Hammond, DOJodi Kierstead, RNNurse Manager, Specialty ICU Northern Light AR Gould Hospital As a nurse manager, Jodis Kiersteads world radically changed when COVID-19 showed up in Maine. She went from managing budgets and staff training to suddenly responding to a pandemic. She enjoyed watching her staff pull together. Youre taking a bunch of people out of their comfort zone and putting them through huge changes and for them to do it with a smile it was amazing! And Jodi did her part to help too. As Northern Light Mercy Hospital in Portland was becoming inundated with patients, they put out a call for additional staff to help. Not only did Jodi travel to Portland and support her colleagues, despite having a 10-month-old baby at home, she and her team assembled a care package for Mercy nurses. We look out for one another. Thats what nurses do. An Jenica Achey, CNA Northern Light Continuing Care, Lakewood Caring for elderly residents at Northern Light Continuing Care, Lakewood is an enormous responsibility that Jenica Achey understands all too well. She works with a vulnerable population, and is living with someone at high risk. Jenica, who rarely leaves her house except for work, canceled out of state travel plans to ensure her family and Lakewood residents are safe. For me, its the gratitude that they all show. You can see it in their faces when you put on their make-up or help them pick out an outfit. During COVID-19, as residents can only communicate with family through closed windows, by phone, or electronically, she says its more important than ever to show comfort and compassion. They cant see your smile with a mask over your face, but your eyes smile too. And they can see that. And that helps them. Jenica Achey, CNAShane Mack Mcpherson Psychiatric Technician Northern Light Acadia Hospital Mack Mcpherson says his co-workers are like his extended family, and they pulled together even more during the extraordinary challenges of running a psychiatric hospital during a global pandemic. Were in the business of working with people who are in some form of crisis, either medical needs or mental health needs. Its just what we do naturally. As a psych tech, Mack considers his job to do what needs to be done to support patients and clinicians. He says the only change for him during COVID-19 is that hes helping other staff with needs too. Hes cleaning, doing small repairs, getting batteries for a thermometer, whatever is needed. The most challenging part of the pandemic for Mack personally is not having face-to-face interactions with co-workers. Acadia is known for being able to recognize when somebody on the team is having a rough day or a rough couple of days. And, we are great at surprising them with their favorite candy or coffee, or writing a card. Shane Mack McphersonCassie CraigParamedic Northern Light Medical Transport Since the start of the pandemic, when a 911 call comes into Northern Light Medical Transport, the caller is screened to see if the patient has COVID-19 symptoms. That way, Cassie Craig knows if she must suit up in full gear, including respirator masks, goggles, gloves, and gowns. This adds some time to the response, but is an important step to protect her and her co-workers, to stop the spread of the virus, and to make sure she can continue her job. She also makes sure to wash her clothes at the station in order to limit any exposure to family members. I would come to work in a pandemic as I would come to work on a Tuesday, this is the job that I signed up for. Its become more difficult lately, but Im going to come to work anyway. Im here to do my job. Cassie CraigBrent Watson, RN, BSN, MLT, CEN, CFRNDirector of Nursing for Emergency Department / Laboratory Services As the director of the Emergency Department at Northern Light Mayo Hospital, Brent Watson spent long hours informing people of evolving CDC guidelines in the early stages of the COVID pandemic. He also spent considerable time traveling to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center to study how they were equipped to handle a potential influx of patients. Since Mayos emergency staff is relatively small, he cross-trained other Mayo nursing staff to work in the Emergency department. Personally, I wouldnt consider myself a hero in any aspect; this is something I signed up for. I am a professional nurse. I love taking care of people; I love taking care of the community in which I live. Brent Watson, RN, BSN, MLT, CEN, CFRNMatt GrantCardiopulmonary Respiratory TherapistNorthern Light Mayo Hospital Matt Grant is one of two full-time respiratory therapists at Northern Light Mayo. Understanding that COVID-19 is a respiratory virus, he knew his services would be in demand if there were an influx of patients. So, he also spent time training staff to make sure they were ready. Both Brent and Matt say its all part of the job, even in a global pandemic. People have been very appreciative, and Id be remiss not to acknowledge that, but I dont consider myself a hero. We havent been hit as hard as some hospitals across the country. They are working nonstop overtime and going out and being in the face of this. I would consider myself lucky, but I wouldnt consider myself a hero by any means. Matt GrantTiffany BennerClinical SupervisorNorthern Light Maine Coast Hospital As a supervisor, Tiffany Benner says the most challenging part of the pandemic was when she didnt have immediate answers for staff. Early on, there were many unknowns would they have enough personal protective equipment? How long would this last? Would there be staff reassignments? She learned to communicate what she knew when she knew it, which helped alleviate fears. She did have a very well laid out plan at home. Once the pandemic reached her county, she would not leave the house, except for work, and her newlywed husband would do the shopping. """"I dont think of myself as a hero. I didnt decide to become a nurse because I thought in 2020 there would be a worldwide pandemic, and it would look awesome when I leave work. I do my job because I like to help people. I like to help the community. Tiffany BennerTammy Violette, RNDirector, Physician PracticesNorthern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center In regular times, Tammy Violettes job involves supporting clinical services and staff of Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Centers Primary Care. But since COVID-19, she has also become an expert in swab and go sites screening and testing people for COVID-19. Tammy helped coordinate staff at the testing site, which was a partnership with the City of Bangor, EMMC, St. Joseph Hospital, and Penobscot Community Health Care (PCHC). How was traffic going to flow? What type of staff were we going to use? How were the swabs going to get collected? How are they going to be housed? So, there was a lot of logistics in terms of details, she explains. Everyone in our community, our eyes have been opened to everyday heroes. Individuals that continue to keep the grocery store stocked so that people can eat during this time. I think that we all just have to remember that were in this together, and we should be thankful for the efforts of all. Tammy Violette, RNLisa Boutwell, PTAPhysical Therapist Assistant Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital Physical Therapy was a service that completely shut down at the start of the pandemic. Lisa Boutwell, PTA went from seeing patients in outpatient rehabilitation to staffing Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospitals drive-up site to screening and testing patients. As a runner, she took the test bag from providers administering the tests to the hospital or lab. Lisa is one of many healthcare staff members who stepped up to serve the community in all kinds of ways, in all kinds of weather. One day out in the testing tent, it was very windy, the walls were blowing in. We also had a snowstorm and large snow piles outside of the tent, but we made do, and our community was safer because of it. Lisa Boutwell, PTAA Leader to HeroesA good leader inspires people to have confidence in the leader; a great leader inspires people to have confidence in themselves. Eleanor Roosevelt A leader who empowers others to act decisively is precisely the type of leader a healthcare system needs during a global pandemic. As the coronavirus began forcing the state of Maine to shut down, Tim Dentry was settling in as president and CEO of Northern Light Health and facing an immediate crisis that would put his experience and leadership skills to the test. On March 24, I was offered the position. It was announced on March 25, and April 1 is when I began these responsibilities, Dentry explains. He had already been with Northern Light Health as chief operating officer for three years and was very familiar with the system. Also, he spent several years in Western Africa and the Middle East working to improve healthcare systems for Johns Hopkins University. During the Ebola outbreak, I was in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates. The Ministry of Health advised us on a Thursday that this is a big issue, and they want us to be the chosen hospital for Ebola response, and by Sunday, we had our first patient, recalls Tim. That experience helped Tim when the first case of COVID-19 appeared in Maine. By the time the state had issued stay-at-home orders, Northern Light Health had already enacted its Incident Command team and its supply chain team had already started preparing for a nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Information Systems and Operational Excellence teams worked to increase delivery of healthcare services through telehealth. Under Tims leadership, Northern Light Health also set up alternative care sites and COVID-19 screening sites. I spent a lot of my time doing what Im doing now, getting out and talking to staff, asking questions, Tim traveled to member hospitals across the state to gather insight and perspective. He visited the Intensive Care Unit at Northern Light Mercy Hospital to see staff caring for COVID-19 patients. It was an emotional moment. So inspiring to me. It gave me strength. When I went to Mercy and AR Gould, I could see the face behind the mask; the eyes behind the mask. I could see fear, and I felt that fear. I could also see determination, and I fed off of that. Tim says he adheres to a philosophy called servant leadership, which he learned early in his career while working in Catholic health systems. He says its an approach that demands humility, which is why he doesnt consider himself a hero. But Tim does believe the people he leads are heroes. Everybodys a hero who has a part to play in this, he says. We have a culture of quality and within that culture of quality is a culture of caring and within the culture of caring is a culture of caring for one another. I want people to know thats what were in the business of doing. HEROES BEHIND THE SCENES While Northern Light Health employs many direct care providers, there are many more working behind the scenes to support them. When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Maine, these people helped keep our front line workers and patients safe during an unprecedented public health crisis. These unsung heroes worked in such areas as supply chain, facilities management, information systems, incident command, and environmental services. Kathy Knight, RNDirector of Emergency PreparednessNorthern Light Health Whenever a natural disaster or emergency strikes, Northern Light Health is prepared, thanks in part to Kathy Knight and her teams work. It is their job to prepare, respond, and recover from emergencies. They hold training throughout the year, and know what to do in an emergency. One priority is activating an incident command structure, which streamlines communications between key decision-makers. For the first time in its history, Northern Light Health had a unified response involving all member organizations. The incident command team had to resolve several issues all at once, including a disruption of the supply chain for personal protective equipment, new work plans based on the latest CDC guidance, and an immediate ramp-up of our information systems to accommodate an increased demand for telehealth services. While there are lessons learned from every emergency, Kathy was pleased with everyones work throughout the system. I look at what we have accomplished from maximizing resources, developing a single coordinated response, delivering transparent, timely, accurate, and standardized communications to all employees, and meeting the challenges of COVID-19 head on by remaining flexible, open-minded and imaginative, and I am just amazed! Kathy Knight, RNPaula Dietrich Behavioral Health ProfessionalNorthern Light Acadia HospitalUnder normal circumstances, Paula would be assisting teachers at Northern Light Acadias Pediatric Day Treatment Program. But, when COVID-19 hit, that program was provided via teleconferencing, and Paulas services were not needed as much. I said, put me where you need me, so here is where I am. The here is the main entrance of the hospital. With a sign-in sheet, a list of questions, and a digital thermometer, her job is to screen visitors, patients, and staff. Like everything she does, Paula takes it to the next level. Ive decorated the entry with butterflies throughout, and I have a beautiful silk flower arrangement with roses and peonies. I love to play string quartet music. And, I try to be calm and welcoming and let people know that we care, explains Paula. I think of what I do as being a part of the team here, and I dont think Im any more heroic than anyone else who is here on staff. Im just doing a little part of what everyone else is doing during the day, and thats it. Paula DietrichDavid ValcikVice President, Information Systems Northern Light Health In mid-February David and the Information Systems (IS) team started testing scenarios if large numbers of employees had to work remotely. They also looked to ramp-up telehealth services. Luckily, they had already started to improve our telehealth and teleconferencing platforms. Northern Light Acadia Hospital had been using Zoom telepsychiatry. Dave and the IS team had to quickly figure out how to expand it to the rest of the system. Before COVID-19, in January, we did approximately 1,500 to 1,700 telehealth visits. By April, we ramped-up to about 34,000. The technology we put in place allowed us to provide care to our patients who could not come in, says Dave. It meant a lot of work in a short time to modify these systems. The IS team played a crucial role in allowing front line staff and support staff to continue working safely while providing exceptional care for patients. Dave, who is also a pilot of a single-engine plane, literally went above and beyond his duties and organized a three plane flyover of Northern Light Hospitals last spring to honor our employees. We do this for a reason, the same as anyone else in the organizationto take care of our patients. The frontline people need our assistance, and were proud to offer that. David Valcik Dani Reardon, CPT, CHWCWellness CoordinatorBeacon Health Dani Reardon leads a virtual fitness class for Northern Light Health employees from a bright and welcoming home gym in the finished basement of her home. They try to follow along as she calls out instructions. Music is playing in the background. We all know that physical activity helps manage stress, depression, and anxiety in addition to keeping your body well, so by offering these noon classes, they can take the class and feel better, explains Dani. I love that Im able to do this; a big part of who I am is helping others. I want people to be well. Im glad I am able to introduce different types of exercise and hopefully participants find a love for it and continue. Dani Reardon, CPT, CHWCCarla LeinoEnvironmental Services Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital Whenever a patient with COVID-19 is treated in the Emergency Department at Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital, they can take comfort in knowing that Carla Leino is on the job. Dressed from head to toe in personal protective equipment, she goes into patient rooms to clean once patients are discharged. She is armed with cleaning chemicals and wipes down every surface as she sanitizes the room from floor to ceiling. We make sure that the cleaning were doing is the best that it can be, not only to protect ourselves but anyone else that will go into the room. When the next patient is coming through the door, that room is ready for them, says Carla. I dont have a special prayer, but I talk to God every day when I leave my house, and I ask him for strength to carry-on and do what I have to do no matter how it makes me feel. Im doing this for the greater good. Im doing his work. It gets me through. Carla LeinoMark Noble Supply Specialist II, Materials Management Department Northern Light Inland Hospital Whenever you need supplies to do your job, Mark Noble is the man who gets you what you need. I dont want anybody to say I dont have what I need when I need it. Until this point, not one person has had to say that, he says with pride. Mark is hoping he can continue to keep that record. Still, having personal protective equipment (PPE) in stock has been challenging during a pandemic that caused a global shortage of PPE and disrupted the entire supply chain. Fortunately, Mark and his team could see the warning signs and took proactive measures to increase ordering and find alternative vendors. We always look out for one another. My whole job is to make sure our patients and employees are safe and they have the equipment they need to stay safe. I take pride in that. Mark NobleCOVID 19: A patients story Baballa Adam knew something was wrong when he couldnt get out of bed on a Thursday morning in early June. He just lay in bed in the top floor apartment of his home in Portlands Valley Street neighborhood. His wife, Saida, called for help to get him to the Emergency Department at Northern Light Mercy Hospital. Baballa would spend the next week in the hospital recovering from COVID-19. He says that he never had difficulty breathing but that he was exhausted. It was very, very scary. I felt like I might not get out of here, like I was going to die, recalls Baballa. Despite regaining his strength and returning home, Baballa did have some lingering effects that required follow-up care. So, Northern Light Home Care & Hospice helped set him up at home with some monitoring equipment to check his temperature and blood pressure. He was also introduced to Laura Webber, post-acute care manager, Northern Light Beacon Health. Laura explains, When I received the referral, he was in the hospital at Mercy, and I followed him daily to see what was going on. He was discharged to Home Care & Hospice with a coup",0,The summary focuses on healthcare activities and community support during the COVID-19 pandemic without mentioning religious concepts or faith-based motivations.

SOME EDUCATION HIGHLIGHTS FROM A VERY ACTIVE PAST YEAR INCLUDE:-NEW CHILDREN'S BOOKS RELEASED AND ALIGNING PROGRAMS EXPANDED: MAINE AUDUBON'S PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN AGES 2-6 AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE BEEN A STAPLE PROGRAM LINE FOR YEARS, SERVING A COMBINATION OF INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES, FEE PROGRAMS WITH CHILDCARE PROVIDERS, AND GRANT PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON PUBLIC PRESCHOOLS AND HEAD START PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT OF OUR NEW WILDLIFE ON THE MOVE CHILDREN'S BOOKS PUBLISHING PARTNERSHIP AND OUR NEWLY ESTABLISHED SEASONAL FAMILY EVENTS SCHEDULE, OUR REACH FOR THESE PROGRAMS HAS EXPANDED TO THE THOUSANDS. DURING THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR, THE SECOND AND THIRD BOOK IN OUR WILDLIFE ON THE MOVE CHILDREN'S BOOK SERIES AND PUBLISHING PARTNERSHIP WERE RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2015 AND MAY 2016 RESPECTIVELY, AND CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH PRAISE. A LITTLE BROWN BAT STORY AND A BLANDING'S TURTLE STORY EACH FEATURE ONE OF MAINE'S ENDANGERED SPECIES AND HIGHLIGHT THE WORK MAINE AUDUBON IS DOING TO CONSERVE THREATENED SPECIES AND CONNECT HABITATS IN WAYS THAT ARE ENGAGING AND COMPREHENSIBLE FOR EVEN VERY YOUNG CHILDREN AND FAMILIES UNFAMILIAR WITH THESE SPECIES, THEIR MOST SIGNIFICANT THREATS, AND CONSERVATION.-LAUNCH OF THE """"BRINGING NATURE HOME"""" PROJECT AND THE INAUGURAL NATIVE PLANTS FESTIVAL & SALE: WITH LEAD FUNDING FROM INFORMED DONORS AND INSPIRATION FROM ENTOMOLOGIST AND AUTHOR DOUG TALLAMY AND HIS BOOK OF THIS TITLE, MAINE AUDUBON HAS PILOTED A NEW INITIATIVE FOCUSED ON ENGAGING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES IN RESTORING NATIVE FOOD WEBS IN GARDENS, YARDS, AND PUBLIC SPACES. THIS YEAR-ROUND, ALL-AGES PROGRAM HAS BEEN ADOPTED AS THE SIGNATURE PROGRAM FOR OUR """"PEOPLE FOR WILDLIFE"""" STRATEGY WITHIN OUR DRAFT STRATEGIC PLAN. MAY 2016 MARKED THE OFFICIAL PUBLIC LAUNCH OF THE FULL PROJECT VIA A LARGE FEATURE IN OUR HABITAT NEWSLETTER AND THE FRUITION OF A NEW EVENT. A SUNNY SATURDAY SERVED AS THE CULMINATION OF OUR PARTNERSHIP CONVENING EFFORTS, A SHOWCASE FOR OUR WORK WITH STUDENTS, A LIVELY FAMILY FESTIVAL ATMOSPHERE, AND NEARLY 300 NATIVE PLANTS AND COUNTLESS SEEDS ADDED TO THE LOCAL LANDSCAPE BY EAGER NEW STEWARDS AND ACTIVISTS.-RECORD YEAR FOR SCHOOL AND ADULT PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS FOR SCARBOROUGH MARSH: IN 2015/2016, WE ENJOYED THE RESULTS OF WORK WE HAVE DONE TO CONSOLIDATE AND BETTER MARKET ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. LAST SUMMER, OUR SEASONAL SCARBOROUGH MARSH AUDUBON CENTER EXCEEDED ALL PREVIOUS REVENUE AND VISITOR MARKS IN THE SAME YEAR WE ENHANCED OUR CAPTURE OF CONTACT INFORMATION, RESULTING IN NEARLY 4,500 NEW RECORDS. AT GILSLAND FARM, OUR STAFF NATURALIST HAS CONTINUED TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN AN ENGAGING ARRAY OF WORKSHOPS AND FIELD TRIPS THAT ENGAGE INCREASING NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS DEEPLY, WHILE OUR CURATED SPEAKER SERIES AND CHARTER BOAT TRIPS CONSISTENTLY MEET OR EXCEED CAPACITY. THE PAST FEW SPRINGS HAVE BEEN VERY BUSY FOR OUR SCHOOL AND PRESCHOOL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS, AND SPRING 2016 SAW A RECORD NUMBER OF THEM BEING FEE PROGRAMS PAID FOR BY THE PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS. ALTHOUGH COST REMAINS A BARRIER FOR MANY SCHOOLS, THESE PROGRAMS BEING SUSTAINED NEARLY ENTIRELY BY THE MARKETPLACE IS ENCOURAGING. THIS ALSO ENABLES MAINE AUDUBON TO STEER FUNDING TOWARDS PARTICULAR CONTENT PRIORITIES AND/OR THE DELIVERY MECHANISMS WITH THE MOST IMPACT.-NEW AND ENRICHED PARTNERSHIPS: OUR USUAL PURSUIT OF PROGRAM GROWTH COMBINED WITH DIRECTIONAL LEADERSHIP FROM THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS YIELDED AND ENHANCED PRODUCTIVE AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS. PARTNERS SUCH AS MAINE DISCOVERY MUSEUM AND ISLANDPORT PRESS HAVE HELPED CONVEY OUR FULL CONSERVATION MESSAGE TO YOUNGER, BROADER AUDIENCES. THE """"BRINGING NATURE HOME"""" PROJECT HAS HELPED US ENGAGE LOCAL LAND TRUSTS, CITY OFFICIALS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS IN NEW WAYS. WE WORKED WITH L.L. BEAN TO HOST THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF THE FREEPORT BIRDING FESTIVAL. THIS YEAR'S EVENT ALSO INCLUDED A MAINE BIRDS FIELD DAY FOR THE ENTIRE K-5 STUDENT POPULATION OF RSU 5, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT INCLUDES FREEPORT, DURHAM, AND POWNAL. ROUGHLY 800 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE EVENT THAT MAINE AUDUBON EDUCATORS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED WITH HELP FROM OUTDOOR DISCOVERY SCHOOL. WE ALSO WORKED WITH THE PORTLAND MUSEUM OF ART TO OFFER ADDITIONAL CONTENT AND ENGAGEMENT SUPPORT FOR A NEW EXHIBIT DEPICTING MIGRATING BIRDS. LASTLY, WE PARTNERED WITH MAINE PROJECT LEARNING TREE TO LAUNCH THE FOREST INVENTORY GROWTH PROJECT WEBSITE AND CITIZEN SCIENCE COLLABORATION. CONSERVATION: MAINE'S WILDLIFE IS BEST STEWARDED WHEN THE NECESSARY QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF HABITAT IS AVAILABLE TO ITS DIVERSE SPECIES. MAINE AUDUBON CONSERVES WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT BY ENGAGING WITH A BROAD RANGE OF PARTNERS TO PROTECT LARGE BLOCKS OF UNDEVELOPED HABITAT; TO ENHANCE AQUATIC AND TERRESTRIAL WILDLIFE PASSAGE STATEWIDE; TO ENGAGE CITIZEN SCIENTISTS IN WILDLIFE AND HABITAT MONITORING; AND TO MANAGE AND CONSERVE RARE, THREATENED, AND ENDANGERED SPECIES. -STREAM BARRIER SURVEYS: MAINE AUDUBON AND ITS PRIMARY PARTNERS, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, SOUGHT TO CREATE A NETWORK OF ACTIONABLE INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY AND REPAIR CULVERTS OR BRIDGES THAT ARE BARRIERS TO FISH AND WILDLIFE MOVEMENT. THROUGHOUT 2014-2015, WE REVIEWED, RANKED, AND MAPPED ALL SURVEY SITES INTO A QUANTITATIVELY-BASED NOMENCLATURE OF BARRIERS, POTENTIAL BARRIERS, AND NO BARRIERS. MAP PRIORITIES WERE BASED ON THE CONDITION OF THE STREAM CROSSING, THE VALUE OF THE AFFECTED HABITAT, AND THE NUMBER OF ACRES POTENTIALLY AFFECTED. (OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, MAINE AUDUBON AND ITS PARTNERS HAVE LED TEAMS IN COMPLETING 6,375 SURVEYS. AS OF THE END OF THE 2015 FIELD SEASON, APPROXIMATELY 70% OF STREAM CROSSINGS IN THE STATE WERE SURVEYED BASED ON HABITAT QUALITY, FAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY.) -STREAM SMART: MAINE AUDUBON, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STREAM SMART COLLABORATIVE (18 AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS), OVERSEES THIS PROGRAM THAT TRAINS CONTRACTORS, LANDOWNERS AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ROAD-STREAM CROSSINGS ON HOW TO CONSTRUCT CROSSINGS THAT MAINTAIN FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT WHILE PROTECTING ROADS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. IN 2015, WE PROVIDED 60 WORKSHOPS WITH 147 PARTICIPANTS FROM 27 TOWNS. IN ADDITION, WE LAUNCHED THE NEW STREAM SMART WEBSITE AND VIDEOS AT WWW.STREAMSMARTMAINE.ORG. THE STREAM SMART WEBSITE OUTLINES THE STEPS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT A STREAM SMART ROAD CROSSING AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS, RESOURCES, AND CONTACT INFORMATION FOR EACH STEP. DURING THE SPRING OF 2016, WE DEVELOPED MATERIALS FOR TRAINING COUNTY SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS FROM THE MAINE LAKESMART PROGRAM TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT STREAM SMART PRINCIPLES AND ASSISTANCE WITH MUNICIPALITIES AND LANDOWNERS - ESPECIALLY SHOREFRONT LANDOWNERS - DURING THE REST OF 2016 AND 2017. (FROM 2012 TO 2015, OVER 745 PEOPLE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN 28 STREAM SMART WORKSHOPS, REPRESENTING 100 TOWNS ACROSS THE STATE.) -ANNUAL LOON COUNT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS, MAINE AUDUBON HAS MANAGED THIS STATEWIDE CITIZEN SCIENCE PROGRAM. YEARLY, WE RECRUIT AND TRAIN AROUND 850 VOLUNTEERS IN COLLECTING DATA ESSENTIAL TO MANAGEMENT OF THIS ICONIC SPECIES. DATA FROM 2015 SHOW THAT THE POPULATION IS RELATIVELY STABLE, ALTHOUGH ANNUAL VARIATION IS COMMON. THE 2015 LOON COUNT ESTIMATE FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE, EXTRAPOLATED FROM THE SAMPLE OF THE 290 LAKES INCLUDED IN THE COUNT, IS 2,818 ADULTS AND 218 CHICKS. FOR ADULTS, THIS REPRESENTS A DROP OF JUST OVER 10% FROM 2014 AND A DROP OF 15% FROM THE ALL-TIME HIGH COUNT OF 3,220 IN 2010. WHILE THE ESTIMATE FOR CHICKS DROPPED BY AN EVEN STEEPER BIT (30%), THAT REALLY IS NOT UNUSUAL. CHICK NUMBERS TYPICALLY VACILLATE FAIRLY WIDELY FROM YEAR TO YEAR, WITH SOME OF THE BIGGER DROPS AND GAINS BEING ON THE ORDER OF 60-75% FROM YEAR TO YEAR. (IN 2014- 2015, WITH PARTNERS, WE INITIATED A STATEWIDE LEAD-TACKLE EXCHANGE, HELPING REDUCE THE LEADING CAUSE OF LOON MORTALITY. WE CREATED FISH LEAD-FREE POSTERS, BROCHURES, AND STICKERS TO HAND OUT AT FISHING CLUBS, BASS DERBIES, AND LAKE ASSOCIATIONS AND GIVE NUMEROUS PRESENTATIONS ABOUT LOONS AND THE FISH LEAD-FREE PROGRAM TO THESE AND OTHER GROUPS. WE ALSO COLLECT LEAD TACKLE AND PROVIDE LEAD-FREE TACKLE SAMPLES TO ANGLERS ACROSS THE STATE.) -COASTAL BIRDS: MAINE AUDUBON WORKED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH MAINE DEPARTMENT OF INLAND FISHERIES AND WILDLIFE, THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, MUNICIPALITIES, AND LANDOWNERS TO MANAGE AND PROTECT NESTING AND MIGRATORY COASTAL BIRDS. WE PLACE SEASONAL BIOLOGISTS, INTERNS, AND VOLUNTEERS ON MAINE BEACHES TO PROVIDE PUBLIC EDUCATION AND PROTECTION FOR ENDANGERED PIPING PLOVERS, LEAST TERNS, RED KNOTS AND OTHER SHOREBIRDS. IN 2015, WE CONTINUED A NEW RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW ENGLAND (UNE) ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES DEPARTMENT, ENGAGING TWO OF THEIR STUDENTS AS INTERNS IN THE PROJECT. THE TWO ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES STUDENTS, WORKING WITH UNE PROFESSOR, DR. NOAH PERLUT, SPENT A COUPLE HOURS A WEEK DURING THE SPRING BREEDING SEASON MONITORING BIRDS AND CONDUCTING OUTREACH AT LOCAL BEACHES. THE PROGRAM WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. (IN 2015, 62 PAIRS NESTED IN MAINE, AND THESE BIRDS RAISED 121 CHICKS TO THE POINT WHERE THEY COULD FLY - THE HIGHEST NUMBER WE HAVE RECORDED SINCE MONITORING BEGAN IN 1981. IN SPRING OF 2016, PLOVERS RETURNED EARLY TO MAINE IN LARGE NUMBERS, A TESTAMENT TO THE MULTIPRONGED APPROACH WE HAVE BEEN TAKING FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS OF MANAGEMENT, OUTREACH, PREDATOR CONTROL, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT.) -BROOK TROUT POND SURVEYS: FOR A FIFTH YEAR, MAINE AUDUBON, RECRUITED AND TRAINED VOLUNTEER ANGLERS TO SURVEY AND ASSESS REMOTE PONDS FOR THE PRESENCE OF WILD AND NATIVE BROOK TROUT. MAINE IS THE LAST STRONGHOLD OF THIS SPECIES AND IDENTIFYING THEIR WATERS IS VITAL TO CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES NEEDED TO PROTECT THIS RESOURCE. IN FIVE YEARS, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SURVEYED 369 REMOTE MAINE PONDS FOR WHICH NO DATA WAS PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. OF THOSE SURVEYED PONDS, VOLUNTEERS RECOMMENDED 145 TO MAINE DEPARTMENT OF INLAND FISHERIES AND WILDLIFE FOR A DETAILED BIOLOGICAL SURVEY AND STANDARD ASSESSMENT. IN 2015, 55 VOLUNTEERS PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY (CONTRIBUTING AROUND 1,270 HOURS VALUED AT AROUND $28,118) EVALUATING 86 PONDS AND SURVEYED 45 STREAMS. (SINCE THE FIRST FIELD SEASON IN 2011, 294 ACTIVE VOLUNTEERS FOR THE BROOK TROUT POND SURVEY PROJECT DONATED OVER 6,058 HOURS TO THE PROJECT.) -NORTHERN FOREST BIRDS: MAINE AUDUBON IS COMPLETED ITS THIRD YEAR OF THE FOREST FOR MAINE BIRDS PROJECT, AN INITIATIVE THAT HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER A DIVERSE GROUP OF LAND MANAGERS, FORESTERS, AND SCIENTISTS TO DEVELOP TOOLS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO MANAGE FORESTS """"WITH BIRDS IN MIND."""" THROUGH THIS COLLABORATION, WE HAVE HOSTED NUMEROUS FORESTRY FOR MAINE BIRDS WORKSHOPS, PREPARED A GUIDEBOOK FOR FORESTERS THAT PROVIDES BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON WHY MAINE FORESTS ARE IMPORTANT TO FOREST BIRDS, WHICH BIRDS ARE OF CONSERVATION CONCERN, WHAT TYPE OF FORESTS AND FOREST ATTRIBUTES DIFFERENT SPECIES NEED, AND HOW TO MANAGE A WOODLOT TO CREATE THE DESIRED HABITAT CONDITIONS FOR 20 DIFFERENT FOCUS SPECIES THAT DEPEND ON STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX, MATURE FORESTS. THIS IS PART OF THE LARGER ATLANTIC FLYWAY INITIATIVE SPEARHEADED BY NATIONAL AUDUBON. -CITIZEN SCIENCE: MAINE AUDUBON'S SCIENTISTS RECRUIT AND TRAIN TEAMS OF """"CITIZEN SCIENCE"""" VOLUNTEERS TO MONITOR AND RECORD DATA ON MAINE WILDLIFE, FROM TRACKING THE NUMBER AND DISTRIBUTION OF CALLING AMPHIBIANS, TO CHANGES IN BAT POPULATION NUMBERS, HELPING MONITOR THE IMPACT OF """"WHITE NOSE SYNDROME"""" IN MAINE. (OVER 2,000 PEOPLE VOLUNTEER YEARLY TO GO OUT IN THE FIELD TO COLLECT IMPORTANT DATA.) ADVOCACY: WE ADVOCATE IN AUGUSTA AND WASHINGTON, DC, FOR POLICIES THAT BENEFIT WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT BY PROVIDING SOLID SCIENCE-BASED INFORMATION AND A BALANCED PERSPECTIVE TO INFORM DECISION MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT CRITICAL CONSERVATION ISSUES. A NUMBER OF THE ISSUES MAINE AUDUBON SUPPORTED LAST YEAR WERE SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESSED IN THE 2015 LEGISLATURE, INCLUDING LEGISLATION IN THESE AREAS:-ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES: THE PROPOSED (LD 807) STATE ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES LIST APPROVED AND INCLUDED THE LITTLE BROWN BAT AND NORTHERN LONG-EARED BAT.-LAKES: THE LEGISLATURE PASSED (LD 568) BANNING THE USE OF FERTILIZER WITHIN 25 FEET OF A GREAT POND (A BODY OF WATER HELD IN TRUST BY THE STATE FOR PUBLIC USE).-MINING: THE HOUSE REJECTED (LD 750) THAT WOULD WEAKEN MINING RULES.-SOLAR: THE ENERGY, UTILITIES & TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE AGREED TO RESOLVE (LD 1263), DIRECTING THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO INITIATE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DISCUSS A POLICY AND/OR PROGRAM FOR INCENTIVES FOR SOLAR PROJECTS OF ALL SCALES.-ENERGY AND EFFICIENCY FUNDING: THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORTED LD 1215, WHICH FIXED CLERICAL ERROR AND REPLACED THE WORD AND"""" THAT WAS INADVERTENTLY MISSING FROM LAST SESSION'S OMNIBUS ENERGY BILL.",0,"The summary focuses on environmental education, wildlife conservation, and community engagement without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

NMG's Children's Case Management program is a home and community based service designed to assist consumers and their families with maximizing their ability to function within their environment. Each consumer receives a thorough psychosocial assessment to identify their strengths and presenting needs. Each comprehensive assessment includes taking a thorough client history, identifying the needs of the individual, and gathering supporting information and documentation from other sources including friends, family, and providers. Strengths Based, comprehensive service plans are developed following the initial assessment and consumers are able to identify individual short and long term goals and specific objectives for meeting those goals. The plans are reviewed minimally every 90 days. Consumers, guardians, and other individuals designated by the consumer are active participants in the assessment and planning process.Through the planning process consumers are linked to supportive services taking care to avoid the duplication of services. Referrals may include but are not limited to medical assessments and services, psychological evaluations, social and natural supports, and educational services. These services are then monitored and evaluated by the Case Manager to ensure that the service plan is effectively implemented and adequately addresses the needs of the consumer.Northern Maine General currently employs three staff persons who provide case management services to children that have been diagnosed with Mental Retardation and Pervasive Developmental Disorders. These staff would continue to provide Case Management services under the mental health license. The current case managers all meet the staff qualifications as defined under Section 13.07-2.B.1.of the MaineCare Benefits Manual. These individuals are responsible for completing the psychosocial assessments, developing the ISP's, providing referrals, participating in crisis resolution services, assisting with residential services, monitoring and coordinating comprehensive services, advocating for consumer needs, and assisting with problem solving and skill development. The program is supervised by a Licensed Clinical Social Worker who is responsible for reviewing and authorizing all psychosocial assessments and ISP's, service reviews, annual assessments, and crisis plans.Consumers served by NMG's Targeted Case Management service meet the eligibility requirements identified in Section 13.03-3.A. of the MaineCare benefits manual. These requirements include; A child with a completed multi-axial evaluation of an Axis I or Axis II diagnosis or a child between birth and five (5) years of age who is determined by a professional approved by the Department as being at risk of developing a mental health disorder due to known environmental or biological risks using DHHS adopted tools, and has significant impairment or limitation in adaptive behavior or functioning according to criteria as established by the Department and determined by a qualified professional approved by the Department. Northern Maine General's Outpatient Services are comprised of professional assessment and counseling services designed to assist consumers with improving functioning, managing disruptive symptoms, decreasing maladaptive behaviors, and promoting positive social, emotional, educational, and vocational growth and development. Services are strengths based and delivered utilizing psychological and sociological evidenced based approaches. Consumers are evaluated and an individualized plan of treatment is developed to maximize personal growth.Children's Outpatient Services assists with improving the consumer's individual functioning and family living environment in order to assist parents, guardians and family members to understand the effects of the consumer's disabilities. Clinicians engage parents and family members and other natural supports to positively affect their consumer's growth and development.Services include a Comprehensive Assessment, diagnosis, individual, family and group therapy. Services focus on the developmental and emotional strengths and needs of consumers and their families. Individual Treatment Plans are created as a collaborative effort between the clinician and consumer and focus on building upon their strengths and existing capabilities.

"Climate and Clean Energy - With NRCM's leadership, Maine has made strong progress to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, cut carbon pollution, and address climate change. Civic engagement and public outreach are at the heart of NRCM's strategies to advance clean air and clean energy. Our work is critical to reducing health and environmental problems affecting our state, including high asthma rates, ocean acidification, rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities, and changes to vital ecosystems. This year NRCM joined with the Conservation Law Foundation in a legal appeal of new rules approved by the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to phase out net metering for homeowners and businesses that have solar power. We want the court to overturn the rules that not only gets rid of net metering (the policy that reimburses people for excess energy sent to the electrical grid) but also charges homeowners and businesses with solar panels for the power they make and use themselves. This new and unfair """"tax""""-known as gross metering-will deter citizens and businesses from installing solar power and harm statewide efforts to reduce fossil fuel use and expand renewable energy sources. A ruling is pending at this time. Simultaneously, NRCM led another effort to boost solar energy in Maine. We engaged communities; created case studies, videos, and factsheets to educate people about the benefits of solar; and worked closely with solar industry leaders, a bipartisan group of policy makers, and our solar coalition, which includes non-traditional allies such as the Maine Municipal Association and Maine Farm Bureau. We sought approval of a proposal to stop gross metering from taking effect and to allow up to 50 households to join in a community solar farm (the current limit is 10). The bill passed with strong support, but the governor vetoed it. NRCM also reached out to citizens, opinion leaders, and businesses in Ellsworth, Maine to launch a community-based weatherization initiative. Our goal was to broker bulk purchasing for the community that would take advantage of Efficiency Maine (EM) programs and use best practices identified by our allies at the Island Institute, Northern Forest Center, and the New England Grassroots Environment Fund. Through our outreach and relationship building, we secured buy-in from community leaders and began the project this spring. Communications - NRCM communicates with our members, supporters, policy makers, and the public using email updates and calls to action, community meetings and events, single issue reports, direct mail, radio, videos, social media, and our website. These diverse tools support our mission and advance our work in each of our issue areas. The NRCM website, www.nrcm.org, is an especially critical tool to reach people with facts and information about our work. A redesign of our website in early 2017 made it completely mobile-responsive, and linked it with our online action alert system so it is easy for people to take action via their mobile devices and tablet computers. More than 35% of users now access our website using a mobile device. Other popular communication tools are NRCM's Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages, which in recent years have seen significant growth in the numbers of people regularly engaging with these sites. Our printed newsletter, Maine Environment is also extremely popular. The newsletter is sent to member households three times per year, and features updates on current environmental issues, upcoming special events, and a special column by NRCM Chief Executive Officer Lisa Pohlmann. As a result of these tools and our efforts to continually improve our communications, we have developed a loyal network of more than 20,000 supporters and activists in Maine and around the country. Emerging Issues - Maine State house NRCM is Maine's top environmental watchdog. Performing within the allowable lobbying limits for a 501(c)3, NRCM monitors issues related to each of our programs as well as emerging environmental issues that could impact Maine's forests, waters, wildlife and community health. Additionally, we represent environmental interests at the Maine Legislature, and before state agencies responsible for managing our state's natural resources. These include the Department of Environmental Protection, the Land Use Planning Commission, and the Public Utilities Commission. Forests & Wildlife - Maine's forests are home to rare and iconic plants and animals, and support jobs in Maine's forest products and outdoor recreation economies. NRCM promotes land conservation, and advocates for well-planned development that does not fragment fish and wildlife habitats. We also promote the sustainable management of timber and other forest resources, and encourage people to get outside and enjoy the beauty of Maine's environment. On August 24, 2017, NRCM and our partners celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument (KWW), established by President Barack Obama on 87,500 acres of beautiful lands in Maine's North Woods. For more than five years, NRCM led the grassroots education and outreach effort that secured support from citizens in the region and across Maine for conservation of this spectacular landscape. We consider the designation of KWW one of our top accomplishments in our nearly 60-year history. In conjunction with the anniversary event, we developed a new publication, Katahdin Woods and Waters - Our Monument, Our Community: Voices from the Region to feature local opinions about KWW and its impact. We also continued to promote KWW via letters to the editor and opinion articles; our webpage featuring how to visit the National Monument and where to stay; and social media about the businesses being created or benefitting from KWW. In early 2018 we learned from the National Park Service (NPS) that 30,000 people from 45 states and nine countries visited KWW in 2017! In addition, NRCM worked with 100 Katahdin area residents to comment on recreational uses at four National Park Service (NPS) land management planning meetings, and we helped recruit the professional team that will work with NPS to develop the official land management plan. NRCM also helped the Friends of Katahdin Woods and Waters create an interpretive map and guide to the KWW """"loop road""""; design their business membership program and solicit businesses; and create policies and procedures that will guide the group in the future. Simultaneously, NRCM testified before the Maine Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC) and mobilized public support in favor of retaining the Adjacency Principle, a core land use planning tool that requires that new development occur within one mile of existing, compatible development. This helps to ensure infrastructure and services are well-planned, direct development toward town centers, and protect wildlife habitat from sprawl. We also followed a LUPC review of a """"concept plan"""" for development proposed by J.D. Irving Woodlands (Maine's largest landowner). The proposal would rezone 51,000 acres of land around the Fish River Chain of Lakes for residential, commercial and industrial development. This area of Maine is internationally known for its wild brook trout population and special recreational experiences. NRCM is working to encourage more conservation in mitigation of any development that may be approved by LUPC. Healthy Waters: Maine's rivers, lakes, and streams are among our state's most precious and celebrated natural resources. Our waterways offer food for fish, birds, and wildlife, drinking water for communities, and they support fishing, paddling, and other recreational businesses. Since our founding, NRCM has worked to decrease water pollution, restore free-flowing rivers, and improve native fish passage. NRCM led efforts to secure a major breakthrough in protecting clean water and Maine taxpayers from the threat of mining pollution. Because of our outreach, citizen engagement, and advocacy, the Maine Legislature voted to pass, and override a governor's veto, LD 870 an Act to Protect Maine's Clean Water and Taxpayers from Mining Pollution. Now, Maine has the most protective mining law in the country. It bans mining in, on, or under public lands, lakes, outstanding rivers, coastal wetlands, and high-value freshwater wetlands. It also requires mining companies to pay enough money up-front to cover a worst-case mining disaster. After five years of intense work on this issue, we are proud to have achieved such a huge win for Maine's environment and people. NRCM also monitored the ongoing cleanup of the Holtrachem site on the Penobscot River in Orrington, Maine, where mercury and chloropicrin, a potent chlorine-based insecticide and WWI chemical weapon, were dumped for decades. A 2010 ruling by the Maine Supreme Judicial Court requires that Mallinckrodt, the current owner of the site, remove contaminated soil and properly remediate a network of sewers. But the cleanup process has been slow, and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has not fully enforced the ruling. NRCM will continue to review DEP documents obtained through Freedom of Access Act (FOAA) requests, watchdog the cleanup progress, and rally public and media attention as needed to hold Mallinckrodt accountable and ensure they do not cut corners. NRCM is a founding partner of the Penobscot River Restoration Trust (PRRT), the successful decades-long project that reconnected endangered Atlantic salmon, shortnose sturgeon, American shad, alewife, and seven other native sea-run fish to 2,000 miles of spawning habitat in the Penobscot watershed, without losing an important source of power generation. PRRT is delivering large-scale ecological, cultural, recreational, and economic benefits throughout the watershed, and we will continue to measure these benefits in the years to come. Sustainable Maine: NRCM has helped Maine phase out toxic chemicals in consumer products. We have also spearheaded the development of Maine's landmark recycling programs for products that pose a risk to our environment and public health. Now, we offer education and hands-on training to citizens' groups and communities to adopt local policies that reduce waste and toxics in the environment, increase recycling and organic composting, and boost the production and use of clean and efficient energy. This year, NRCM expanded upon our past success and helped more communities adopt ordinances to ban or put a fee on single-use plastic bags. To date fifteen towns (Portland, South Portland, Cape Elizabeth, York, Saco, Kennebunk, Falmouth, Freeport, Topsham, Brunswick, Bath, Belfast, Blue Hill, Rockland, and Manchester) collectively representing 17% of Maine's population have adopted bag policies to reduce plastic pollution that harms fish and birds, and ends up in Maine's landfills. We are currently supporting citizen-led efforts to ban bags and polystyrene foam in Bethel, Waterville, Damariscotta, Bar Harbor, and Ellsworth. With enough local policies, Maine businesses and state leaders will desire consistency and support a statewide ban on reusable bags and polystyrene foam packaging. NRCM also supported efforts to reduce food waste in Maine through a proposal to increase liability protections for food donors, create a tax credit for farmers that donate to food pantries, and establish a task force to develop guidance to reduce food waste in homes, businesses, and schools. From this work, a stakeholder group came together to examine ways to reduce food waste and food insecurity, and increase composting. We helped recruit stakeholders from food pantries, restaurant and grocer trade groups, farmers, scholars, policy makers, conservationists, and composting and waste hauling businesses. All participants agreed that Maine needs to reduce food waste in schools. Ultimately, the state adopted a plan for the DEP to provide guidance to help reduce food waste in schools, institutions, and municipal buildings. NRCM also worked directly with eight K-12 schools in various parts of Maine to begin food waste separation and create school gardens and composting programs. Reducing food waste saves taxpayers thousands of dollars and protects the environment. Federal Policy: NRCM's Federal Policy Project cultivates and mobilizes public and business support to urge Maine's Congressional leaders to stand up for the health and well-being of Maine people and oppose federal environmental rollbacks. NRCM produces reports on issues such as the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), generates group sign-on letters, produces compelling print ads, and organizes both high volume and high quality communications to Maine's Senators. This year we organized support for the EPA budget, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Rule, and the Clean Power Plan. This is a burgeoning part of our work and we are finding more and more people want to speak up on issues at the federal level that impact Maine.",0,The summary focuses on environmental advocacy and clean energy initiatives without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts.

"Community-Based Services: Family Planning Association of Maine (FPA) provides funding, technical support and quality assurance to 46 clinics statewide in addition to operating clinics in Augusta, Belfast, Damariscotta, Farmington, Lewiston, Norway, Rockland, Rumford, Skowhegan, and Waterville serving the family planning needs of approximately 27,000 low-income Maine women, men and teens annually. FPA's services are confidential, offered on a sliding fee scale, state-of-the-art, and include: comprehensive medically accurate reproductive health care information to help clients make informed decisions about their reproductive health and lives gynecological exams colposcopy for evaluation of abnormal Pap tests family planning pregnancy testing and options counseling emergency contraception STD and HIV testing and treatment screenings for reproductive cancers first-trimester medication and aspiration abortion care servicesDuring 2013, 86% of our clients were low-income and a visit to one of our centers was often the only health care they received. Half of all sexually active Maine teens sought counseling and services from a family planning health center and many of these young people continue to use our trusted services through adulthood. In 2013, 5,379 teens were provided the care they needed to prevent unintended pregnancy and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.According to 2005 data (the most recent data available), Maine's teen pregnancy rate is 3rd lowest in the nation. From 1998 to 2005, Maine's teen pregnancy rate dropped an amazing 48%. Education and Research Projects: In 2013, the FPA continued to provide Maine teens with sexual health information that is medically accurate and age appropriate. Designed with input from Maine teens, www.maineteenhealth.org provides sexual health information, a guide to Maine's family planning clinics, and an interactive place to get answers to their sexual health questions. The FPA's text messaging service, AskMTH, allows teens to use their cell phones to text anonymous questions and get answers from a trained family planning professional. In 2013, our text line fielded 314 questions from 94 different teens, indicating that teens find the service useful and return to it again and again. During FY2013, our teen website received and answered 104 questions from Maine teens.In 2013, Family Planning Association hired an Outreach and Marketing Coordinator to facilitate and strengthen partnerships between the FPA and other local and statewide organizations. Outreach collaborations work to reinforce and facilitate referrals to Family Planning clinics and other services, provide shared learning opportunities for FPA and partner agency staff, and solidify FPA as the leading resource for reproductive health care services and education in Maine. Locally, connections have been made with sexual assault, domestic violence, social service providers and case workers, and community-based public health programs; statewide collaborators include the Maine Coalition Against Sexual Assault, Maine Families home visitation program, MaineCare services, The Horizon Program (providing care and services for Mainers with HIV/AIDS), and Health Affiliates Maine (a network of behavioral health providers). Since January of 2013, over 80 in-person connections, some with formalized partnership agreements, have been made through the Outreach program. During FY2013, through the FPA's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, Prevention Coordinators worked with educators in 17 schools and community-based organizations statewide to deliver a variety of evidence-based, comprehensive sexuality education curriculums focused on preventing HIV/STDs and pregnancy, reaching 1,053 youth. In order to sustain sexuality education efforts, we continue to provide training and professional development through web-based sessions, in-person trainings and statewide conferences. In the past school year (2012-13), a total of 257 educators from schools, youth-serving organizations and government agencies attended these training opportunities.During FY2013, the FPA's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program also continued its work through the federally funded Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), partnering with Jobs for Maine's Graduates (JMG) to deliver evidence based programming. During the 2012-13 school year 310 students participated in the All4You! curriculum in 13 high schools located in Maine communities with high teen pregnancy rates. Evaluations showed increased knowledge and improved attitudes around HIV/STDs, pregnancy prevention, and behaviors that put teens at risk and preventive measures like abstinence, birth control and condom use.Similar to our community-based services, funding for the FPA's education and research projects is provided by State and Federal agencies (that also monitor program operations and outcomes), foundation grants and other restricted revenues. Agency and Mission-Related Projects: Since 1971, the FPA's Public Affairs staff has worked to protect the reproductive rights of all Maine citizens. The Family Planning Association is founded on the premise that Maine women and teens must have access to comprehensive reproductive health care and information in order to control their reproductive lives. The FPA Public Affairs efforts are designed to promote and protect programs and services statewide to ensure affordable access to family planning. In FY2013, the Family Planning Association of Maine focused much of its advocacy efforts on defeating legislation aimed at restricting access to reproductive health care in Maine. Despite the fact that Maine has repeatedly demonstrated its support for reproductive privacy in recent years, bills limiting this privacy continue to appear before the Maine Legislature, forcing the FPA and our coalition partners to dedicate considerable time and effort to defeat them. Each new legislative session brings new legislators who require education to dispel myths about reproductive health care and reproductive rights, and to help them recognize reproductive health care as basic health care for women, rather than simply a political issue. With the assistance of many coalition partners, the FPA was able to again defeat every bill that threatened reproductive health care in the 2013 legislative session.We continue to rely on a strong network of pro-choice, pro-family planning grassroots activists who communicate very powerfully with their elected representatives, and will continue to be vigilant in protecting and expanding access to the full range of reproductive health care for all women, men and teens in Maine.Private contributions and agency-endowed resources fund these projects. No public funds are used. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provided incentive funds to eligible providers to meet compliance guidelines associated with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). Also called """"meaningful use"""" funds, these awards allowed the FPA to focus on technology and training needs to adopt a successful Electronic Health Record (EHR) program and be able to use EHR to meet federal health policy priorities.",0,"The summary focuses on family planning, reproductive health services, and education without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"Stewardship and Trail ProjectsAt least 40 people have worked with FCT this year to build and maintain trails. Some are dependable longtime volunteers, others were enthusiastic, first time helpers. Highlights include: establishing new trails at Simpson Woods and Walsh Preserve, establishing the Tadpole Trail and Whippoorwill Trail in east Freeport, building 200 feet of boardwalk on Jackman trail, and doing boardwalk extensions and upgrades on other trails. Ongoing FCT property stewardship work included annual property inspections and trail cleanup after storms. We worked with several landowners to assure their activities are or will be consistent with easement provisions, addressed trespass issues, posted trails on private property that were temporarily closed because of logging, made repairs after vandalism at trailheads, and followed up on a small forest fire caused by illegal campers. Land protectionFreeport Conservation Trust (FCT) acquired three properties and an easement in 2020. In June, we received 9.63 acres from the estate of Horace Hildreth. The property is adjacent to FCTs Powell Point Preserve and will make a nice addition to the preserve. In February, FCT acquired 5 acres and an easement on an adjacent 15 acres from the estate of Elizabeth Simpson. This project protects a stream and offers a trail in a neighborhood that previously had no conserved land. In December, FCT acquired 12.7 acres on the Cousins River. To be known as the Walsh Preserve, there are short trails to dramatic marsh overlooks. This acquisition was made possible with grants from the North American Wetland Conservation Act via the Appalachian Mountain Club, Davis Conservation Fund, Casco Bay Estuary Program, local businesses and individuals. This acquisition is part of a collaboration between Maine Coast Heritage Trust, Royal River Conservation Trust and FCT to expand conservation of the relatively undeveloped Cousins River and marsh. It is a valuable buffer against sea-level rise, important wildlife habitat, and offers an opportunity for low impact public recreation. Over the last 30 years, FCT has been amassing Cousins River frontage. FCT secured two trail permissions from landowners that have allowed new trails to be built, linking existing trails and expanding FCTs trail system. Community Outreach In March our world was rocked by the coronavirus pandemic. At FCT, we quickly realized that although people from Freeport and the region were staying close to home, they were getting out often, more than ever before, to explore local trails. We stepped up our trail work and outreach, with extra attention to sharing information about trails, keeping the trails clear after spring storms, upgrading trail infrastructure, promoting nature-based activities, and sharing seasonal nature observations. FCT organized the 6th annual Freeport Trail Challenge in September and October 2020: 169 adults, 148 youth and 28 dogs completed the Trail Challenge by taking a hike at four trails around town. Participants came from 20 towns. These numbers are a significant increase over the previous year. FCT modified the challenge to make it safe to participate in a pandemic. Freeport Conservation Trust offers public walks year-round on trails in town. There was a hiatus on public walks last spring, but since the summer we have led numerous walks, including partnering with L.L. Bean and other local organizations. We collaborated with Wolfes Neck Center and Wolfes Neck Woods State Park to publish a new Wolfes Neck Trail map.Although in-person FCT outreach activities did not happen in the spring, in January 2020, local contributors to the book A Dangerous New World, Maine Voices on the Climate Crisis presented at an event organized by FCT and co-sponsored by Freeport Arts & Cultural Alliance. We offer free state park passes through the Freeport Community Library, with the hope of increasing access for people to get outdoors. FCTs annual newsletter was mailed town-wide in the spring. A distanced, in person Annual Meeting was held in September. FCT engages its members and the public throughout the year via email, Facebook and Instagram. FCT board and staff engage with the Town of Freeport municipal government in various ways, which this year included: pursuing the Concord Brook Trail as part of L.L.Beans campus building project, engaging in development review to promote conservation of open space, and coordination and trail work with the Conservation Commission.",0,"The summary focuses on trail building, land conservation, and community outreach activities without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

BY THE TIME THE CLEO FUND APPROACHED THE AWS, IT HAD SPAYED/NEUTERED NEARLY 40,000 CATS AND DOGS. PEOPLE IN NEED OF HELP TO SPAY/NEUTER THEIR PETS WOULD SIMPLY CALL THE FUND AND REQUEST HELP. IF APPROVED, THEY WOULD MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AT A PARTNERING CLINIC AND THE CLEO FUND WOULD PAY 80% OF THE TOTAL BILL IF THE CLINIC AGREED TO DISCOUNT THE COSTS BY 20%.AS OF JANUARY 1, 2013, THE AWS ASSUMED FULL MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND. UPON ASSUMING MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND, AND IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY ITS ADMINISTRATION AND MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SUBSIDIZED SPAY/NEUTER, THE AWS CONTACTED EACH OF THE PARTICIPATING VETERINARIANS TO LET THEM KNOW THAT WE WERE STANDARDIZING THE PRICES, REQUIRING THE CLIENT TO CONTRIBUTE $50 TOWARD THE COST OF A DOG SPAY/NEUTER AND $30 TOWARD THE COST OF A CAT SPAY/NEUTER, AND GOING TO A VOUCHER SYSTEM.

EQUALLY ATTRACTED TO THE FICTITIOUS DR. JEKYLL AND DRACULA AS TO THE ACTUAL GRUESOME HISTORY OF REVOLUTIONARY WAR BATTLES THAT OCCURRED IN HIS OWN PENNSYLVANIA BACKYARD, WYETH COMBINED REALITY AND FANTASY IN HIS PAINTINGS. ANDREW WYETH: WORLD WAR IMARCH 23 LATE 2019WYETH STUDY CENTER GALLERYTHIS EXHIBITION OF WATERCOLORS AND TEMPERAS AFFORDS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW ANDREW WYETH'S CHILDHOOD INTEREST IN WORLD WAR I, FUELED BY CHRISTMAS GIFTS OF TOY SOLDIERS, BECAME A LIFE-LONG SOURCE OF INSPIRATION. BORN IN 1917, WYETH WAS TOO YOUNG TO REMEMBER THE WAR BUT IT BECAME REAL TO HIM TO THINGS IN HIS FATHER'S STUDIO. N.C. WYETH PAINTED SEVERAL LARGE-SCALE CANVASES OF WORLD WAR I SUBJECTS, AND COLLECTED UNIFORMS, WEAPONS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS FOR SOURCE MATERIAL. HE ALSO WATCHED KING VIDOR'S EPIC 1925 SILENT FILM ABOUT AN AMERICAN SOLDIER'S EXPERIENCES FIGHTING IN FRANCE, THE BIG PARADE, OVER AND OVER. AS AN ADULT, WYETH BEFRIENDS REAL LIFE SOLDIERIES LINING NEAR HIS HOMES IN CHADDS FORD, PENNSYLVANIA, AND IN CUSHING, MAINE.

THE PAINTERS ALEX KATZ, HIS WIFE JEAN COHEN, AND THEIR FRIEND LOIS DODD, WHO OWNED A HOUSE ON SLAB CITY ROAD IN LINCOLNVILLE, WERE AMONG THE FIRST. THEY WERE SOON FOLLOWED BY THE PHOTOGRAPHER AND FILMMAKER RUDY BURCKHARDT AND HIS WIFE, PAINTER YVONNE JACQUETTE. THE MULTI-TALENTED PAINTER-SCULPTOR-INSTALLATION ARTIST RED GROOMS CAME HERE WITH HIS WIFE, THE PAINTER MIMI GROSS, AND PAINTER RACKSTRAW DOWNES SOON FOLLOWED. NEIL WELLIVER WAS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS GATHERING OF SUMMER RESIDENT ARTISTS, CHOOSING INSTEAD TO LIVE HERE YEAR-ROUND, COMMUTING TO PHILADELPHIA TO TEACH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. WHAT THEY FOUND IN AND AROUND THE MIDCOAST VILLAGE OF LINCOLNVILLE WAS A SIMPLE LIFESTYLE THAT OFFERED A WELCOME RESPITE FROM THE OFTEN FRENETIC PACE AND ALL-ABSORBING NATURE OF LIFE IN NEW YORK. AN ADDED BENEFIT WAS THAT IT WAS RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE TO LIVE HERE, IMPORTANT TO ARTISTS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THEIR CAREERS WHEN FINANCIAL SECURITY WAS SOMETHING SOUGHT BUT FAR FROM A REALITY. IMPORTANTLY, THEY ALSO FOUND ATTRACTIVE SUBJECT MATTER FOR THEIR WORK. SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST STYLES THAT DOMINATED CRITICAL CIRCLES IN NEW YORK, MAINE'S COASTS, ISLANDS, WOODLANDS, AND PEOPLE PROVIDED THE ARTISTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE NEW DIRECTIONS THROUGH THEIR LARGELY REPRESENTATIONAL WORK BASED ON WHAT THEY SAW AND EXPERIENCED HERE.

"COMMUNITY SERVICE - THE MAINE MIGRANT HEALTH PROGRAM IS A 330G MIGRANT VOUCHER PROGRAM. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT OPERATE OUT OF A FIXED SITE OR """"BRICKS AND MORTAR"""" HEALTH CENTER BUT THROUGH 4 MOBILE MEDICAL UNITS. MMHP'S SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WHERE THEY ARE MOST NEEDED, WHERE FARMWORKERS LIVE AND WORK. . MOBILE MEDICAL CLINICS, CARE COORDINATION, PESTICIDE SAFETY TRAININGS, HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS, ETC. ALL TAKE PLACE IN FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES - THEIR CAMPS, HOMES, AND WORK PLACES. THESE SERVICES ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF MIGRANT VOUCHER PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND PROVIDE A STRONG BASE OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT CREATE ACCESS. MMHP'S EXISTING SERVICE AREA IS THE ENTIRE STATE OF MAINE (33,215 SQ M) WITH MAJOR HARVEST AREAS IN AROOSTOOK, HANCOCK, WASHINGTON, AND ANDROSCOGGIN COUNTIES. BOTH WASHINGTON AND AROOSTOOK QUALIFY AS """"VERY RURAL"""", THEIR POPULATION DENSITY BEING 14.0/SQ M AND 11.6/SQ M, RESP. AROOSTOOK COUNTY HAS THE DISTINCT HONOR OF BEING THE ONLY COUNTY EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI THAT QUALIFIES AS A FRONTIER DESIGNATED AREA. IN ADDITION, PARTS OF THESE MAJOR HARVEST AREAS HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS, MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS, OR AS HAVING A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION.

THESE TECHNIQUES HAVE RESULTED IN STEADILY INCREASING ACCESS TO DENTAL SERVICE EACH YEAR. MOBILE MEDICAL UNITS - AS DISCUSSED, PART OF MAINE MIGRANT'S UNIQUE MODEL OF SERVICE DELIVERY IS DIRECT DELIVERY OF CARE AT WORKER CAMPS, IN COMMUNITIES, AND AT WORK SITES.

MAINE CENTER ON DEAFNESS ALSO PROVIDES EQUIPMENT SPECIFIC TO THE EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, CLIENTS RECEIVE THEIR CHOICE OF EITHER A ONE-WAY PAGER OR TWO-WAY PAGER. THESE DEVICES RECEIVE E-MAIL BASED EMERGENCY ALERTS SO THAT FOLKS WHO CANNOT HEAR THE RADIO HAVE VISUAL ACCESS TO EMERGENCY INFORMATION SENT OUT BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, MAINE TURNPIKE AUTHORITY, PUBLIC SAFETY, AND OTHERS. WEATHER RADIOS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO PREFER THAT METHOD OF NOTIFICATION. CLIENTS QUALIFY FOR EITHER 'LENDING' (NO COST) OR 'COST SHARE' (LOW COST) EQUIPMENT ON A SLIDING SCALE BASIS. MOST CLIENTS QUALIFY FOR THE LENDING OPTION, AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BORROW THE EQUIPMENT FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED OR WANT IT. ALTHOUGH MAINE'S POPULATION IS RATHER SMALL WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER STATES, THE EQUIPMENT PROGRAM MAINTAINS A HEALTHY DEMAND FOR SERVICES. THE EQUIPMENT PROGRAM PARTNERS WITH MCD'S OUTREACH PROGRAMS IN THE FORM OF PRESENTATIONS TO BUSINESSES, ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS. PROGRAM STAFF WILL ALSO CONDUCT HOME VISITS FOR CLIENTS WHO NEED TRAINING ON THE EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE OBTAINED THROUGH THE PROGRAM. EQUIPMENT IS DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO CLIENTS VIA UPS ALLOWING EQUAL DELIVERABILITY TO ALL CLIENTS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED IN THE STATE. THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ADDED HEARING AIDS TO THE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT THAT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED UNDER THE TEP PROGRAM. TOTAL CLIENTS SERVED WITHIN THE EQUIPMENT PROGRAM THIS YEAR: 184; TOTAL UNITS OF EQUIPMENT DISTRIBUTED THIS YEAR: 360 IN AN EFFORT TO BETTER SERVE ALL OF THE NEEDS OF THE D/DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING POPULATION, MCD ALSO SELLS ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STATE PROGRAM.

OVER 20 NEW CASES WERE OPENED WITH OVER 30 CONTINUING FROM THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR. MCD'S TOTAL CASELOAD EXCEEDED 50 CASES.

HAMILTON RELAY SERVICES: MANY OF THE CLIENTS SERVED THROUGH MCD'S EQUIPMENT PROGRAM USE EQUIPMENT THAT DEPENDS ON ACCESS TO MAINE'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS RELAY SERVICE (MERS). THE RELAY SERVICE UTILIZES THE SKILLS OF 'COMMUNICATION ASSISTANTS' (CA WHO FACILITATE PHONE CALLS BETWEEN PEOPLE USING TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PHONE EQUIPMENT. AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE A DEAF PERSON USING A TTY OR VIDEOPHONE MAKING A PHONE CALL TO ORDER A PIZZA; CHANCES ARE THE PIZZA PARLOR WILL NOT HAVE A TTY OR VIDEOPHONE READY TO ANSWER THE CALL; THEREFORE THE DEAF PERSON MAKES THE CALL THROUGH THE RELAY SERVICE. EVERYTHING THE DEAF PERSON TYPES OR SIGNS IS THEN VOICED BY THE CA TO THE PIZZA PARLOR STAFF. VOICED RESPONSES ARE THEN TYPED OR SIGNED BY THE CA BACK TO THE DEAF PERSON. THE RELAY SERVICE ENSURES THAT THE DEAF PERSON HAS EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PHONE LINE AND IS NOT LIMITED IN THEIR CALLING ACCESS.

Please see the following excerpt from the Northern Light Health Annual Report 2021 to the Community for details of community benefit projects at NLH members:Community partnershipsTeamworkThe greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members."""" - Coretta Scott King These words strongly resonate when we look across our Northern Light Health community. If we measure a community's greatness by the compassionate actions of its members, then we are truly surrounded by greatness and there is much to celebrate. Our culture of caring begins with caring for one another and extends to the care we deliver to people across Maine in the many communities we serve. But if the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that compassion is evident not only in our excellent staff and community members but also in our community partners. Your generosity and innovation have helped extend our reach in living up to our promise to make healthcare work for the people we serve. Our list of community heroes is long, and this Annual Report only features a handful of the people and organizations who have made an important difference during a challenging time. We hope you find these stories as empowering and inspirational as we do.Timothy J. Dentry, MBA President & CEO Northern Light HealthKathy Corey Board ChairNorthern Light HealthA vaccine for everyone AccessOn a sunny July day, a brightly colored RV emblazoned with the faces of children from across the world sits parked outside the Luca Caf in Arundel. The Luca Caf is a quaint seasonal restaurant with Asian-inspired food that has covered outdoor seating and picnic tables. Standing beside some tables and folding chairs in front of the RV, Peggy Akers, RN, and Mary Robbins, RN, two Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses, administer doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to a diverse and willing group of peoplea group which might not have been vaccinated if not for the convenience of this mobile clinic and all the community partners that made it possible. There are populations that we are just not reaching. People who are undocumented, who would feel unsafe coming to a mass vaccination clinic where they might otherwise be asked to present identification or insurance information. We as an organization make it our mission that the only requirements for getting vaccinated are, are you a human being and do you want to be vaccinated? shares Robbins.Their partners for this clinic are Maine Community Action Partners, the New England Arab American Organization, Maine Association for New Americans, Maine Access Immigrant Network (MAIN), and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 Community Support Team. Chanbopha (Chan) Himm is also a member of the support team and co-founder of the Cambodian Community Association and Unified Asian Communities. Her mission is to help get people in underserved populations vaccinated. As some Asian Americans show up, she speaks with them in their native language and offers assurances. She has a welcoming smile and charisma, which seems to make her a natural fit for this kind of work. """"They couldn't ask for a better place to get vaccinated,"""" explains Himm, """"because they've got the nurses here that care so much about them. And then they've got their cultural brokersthe ones doing the translations, the community leaders standing right behind them and letting them know that they're going to be okay. What more can someone ask for?"""" Himm is not just offering lip service when she compliments the Northern Light Home Care & Hospice nurses doing the clinics. Both Akers and Robbins have been doing this kind of work for a long time with community partners and have earned praise for their compassion and sensitivity. """"I feel so lucky in a way to be part of this journey. Doing these vaccines has just been such a gift,"""" shares Akers.If you would like to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine or get vaccinated, please visit https://covid.northernlighthealth.org/Good health is good businessResiliencyA light summer breeze comes off the Union River as customers gather on picnic tables shaded by umbrellas on the lawn outside the Union River Lobster Pot restaurant in Ellsworth. They are hoisting glasses of cold draft beer as servers carry out plates piled high with steamed clams and boiled lobster garnished with leafy green parsley and lemon wedges. To restaurant owner Brian Langley, the summer of 2021 looks a lot different than the summer of 2020. It's a lot closer to normal, at least in terms of business volume. """"We've seen a real influx of customers looking to escape to Maine from wherever they were in the country. They had to get out, and they wanted to go someplace safe. Maine was the epitome of both of those things, says Langley.But as normal as things look, it was a challenge to get here. Like many business owners, Langley was dealing with so many unknowns. How could he keep employees and customers safe from COVID-19? How could he overcome supply chain issues, staffing shortages, social distancing requirements, and government mandates? For these questions and more, Langley turned to Northern Light Health which had started offering business-to-business webinars via the Zoom video conferencing portal. """"We call these webinars Good Health is Good Business,"""" explains Carrie Arsenault, MBA, president of Northern Light Beacon Health, which spearheads the webinar series. """"We bring experts together from across Northern Light Health and share resources and advice on how to return to business safely for employees, visitors, and customers."""" As a large employer dealing directly with COVID-19, Northern Light Health had the expertise and resources that business owners needed, with experts in infection prevention, supply chain, finance, and behavioral health, to name a few. """"One of the reasons you found me every two weeks watching the webinars was to get an idea of what we would be facing, explains Langley. I looked for trusted information, and there you had it from the horse's mouth. You could ask the doctors and other experts direct questions, and if they didn't know something they acknowledged that. It wasn't curated, it was objective and unbiased"""" Langley explains. A planning group meets regularly to discuss topics, create presentations, and book panelists. James Jarvis, MD, FAAFP, Physician Leader, Incident Command, Northern Light Health, is a frequent panelist because of his expertise in the COVID-19 response. """"Initially, I think they just wanted updates on what healthcare was doing and what was going on in our communities in relation to COVID-19. We realized that we needed to be a voice of science and reason to help mitigate fear. There was so much unknown in the beginning part of this pandemic that we felt an obligation to inform our businesses and communities of what we knew and what we thought was going to happen,"""" explains Dr. Jarvis. Another panelist, Yemaya St. Clair, LCPC, counselor, Northern Light Work Force EAP, was brought in to offer mental health advice to business owners. Many recognized that their employees, and in some cases customers, were struggling to cope with the new normal of the pandemic. """"Early on, when the masking mandates went into effect, we provided coaching around de-escalation, to help people stay calm. We also provided resiliency training and ways to help manage stress,"""" shares St. Clair. For Brian Langley, valuable advice helped him navigate an uncertain time, helped his employees cope, and provided current information to help adapt his business. He used the pandemic as an opportunity to try new menu items and offerings, such as outdoor seating. Eventually, Langley took what he learned and shared it with other business owners as a webinar panelist. """"What can I do that's different, and how do I survive? I think that's what I wanted to share,"""" explains Langley. Arsenault says Northern Light Beacon Health will continue offering the webinars as long as there is a community need. """"We are thrilled to be part of the solution to create healthy employees, healthy businesses and, as a result, healthy communities.""""Ladders of opportunityPart 1 DiversityWhen Ngozi Christopher, RN, BSN, first started working at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center in 2017, she had already worked as a nurse for several years in Nigeria. She had clinical experience and a nursing education but didn't know how steep the cultural curve would be. She remembers one particularly difficult exchange with a patient's wife who was mad at Ngozi because she wouldn't make constant eye contact with her or her husband.

"In 2009, Friends of Acadia (FOA) granted $21,730 to Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT) to purchase five acres of wetlands. In 2011, land on Bass Harbor Marsh that was held in partnership with MCHT sold to the NPS, with $19,951 revolving back into Friends of Acadia's land conservation fund. In 2009, FOA donated $50,000 to MCHT to purchase an option on thirty-nine acres on Lower Hadlock Pond. The closing on this property occurred in two stages; in 2010 MCHT and FOA acquired a portion of the land with FOA contributing $150,711. In 2011, the partners sold a conservation easement on the acquired parcel to the NPS, and FOA was reimbursed $200,711 that revolved back into Friends of Acadia's land conservation fund. In 2011, MCHT purchased the second half of the Lower Hadlock Pond property. FOA raised funds for this project through its benefit auction and other conservation-minded donors. Of these funds, $200,000 was sent to the Pew Charitable Trusts in support of the Northeast Land Trust Consortium, which is able to provide up to a 50% match on grants made for this initiative. The consortium supports the MDI Conservation Opportunities Initiative II, an effort to support the acquisition and protection of substantially undeveloped parcels on or in the proximity of Mount Desert Island in Maine. Also in 2011, FOA and MCHT purchased 5 acres on Round Pond (Round Pond II). FOA paid $276,730 for 49% ownership, with the intent that the land be sold to Acadia National Park when funding becomes available. Finally, FOA pledged a $170,000 grant toward the purchase of approximately twenty-three additional acres on Round Pond (Round Pond I) to be paid in 2013. This property will be donated to Acadia National Park in 2016 to celebrate the park's centennial. The Carriage Road maintenance grant makes possible the salaries of six Acadia National Park workers who perform regular maintenance of the park's 44 miles of historic carriage roads. In 2011, the workers repaired winter storm damage, including surface damage, erosion and storm damage. Crews replaced intersection signs, added surface material to about 10 miles of carriage roads, cut vistas, and repaired ditching. This program uses thousands of volunteer hours from FOA's volunteer program, and also uses the Acadia Youth Conservation Corps student employees.

Since its first day of operation in 1999, 4.1 million visitors have ridden the bus, approximately 1.5 million private vehicle trips have been eliminated, reducing smog causing pollutants by an estimated 22 tons and green house gas emissions by over 14,000 tons. Friends of Acadia has been involved with the bus systems since its inception, granting $2.5 million in funding, and securing more than $2.28 million in grants from L.L. Bean and others to enable continued growth. Friends of Acadia's grant supplements the operating costs of 25 buses on Mount Desert Island, one in Ellsworth, and one on the Schoodic peninsula.

With TREE, teachers, students, families, and communities are coming together in ways that provide opportunities and hope for addressing the many stressors which affect our schools. Teachers are moving from managing behavior to understanding students and how the brain works. By looking through this different lens which puts relationships at the center, TREE is supporting all engaged, ensuring ALL voices are heard. With a commitment to putting human connection at the center and understanding the importance of creating space for difficult conversations and intentional reflection, TREE can foster enduring shifts in practice and policy.

"The Community-Based Mentoring Program serves youth between ages 6-young adult that are facing adverse childhood experiences and are primarily living in single-parent low-income homes by providing one-to-one mentoring relationships with professionally supported, volunteer Big Brothers and Sisters. Volunteers are screened, trained and vetted by BBBS professional staff and carefully matched with each Little. Bigs and Littles spend time monthly engaging in a variety of healthy activities. Staff provide ongoing monthly support to every volunteer, child and child's family. On an annual basis, over 80% of Big and Little matches exceed their one-year match anniversary and many will stay connected for several years with the average match length being 44.7 months or just under four years! BBBS/BB matches relationships exceed the national average match-length by 55%. These relationships help children build resiliency against adversity, grow their self-esteem and aspirations, build connections within the community, learn to better avoid risky behaviors and experience an overall improved life-trajectory for future success. In 2020 seventy-three children, an equal number of volunteers and their families were served by the Community-Based Mentoring Program.

This is one of our Site-Based Mentoring Program and it connects Bowdoin students (bears) with children (cubs) in our community. Bears and Cubs participate in supervised activities at the Bowdoin College campus during six Sunday sessions each semester. This program also involves two student leaders who work with Big Brothers Big Sisters staff to organize, plan and support the program ongoing.

Volunteers are vetted, trained and supported on-going. Children participating in these programs achieve greater self-confidence, are better able to express feelings, have increased interests and hobbies, have improved academic performance, better classroom behavior and several other positive outcomes!

THE MRC, AFTER A LENGTHY EVALUATION PROCESS PRIOR TO 2015, HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PERC FACILITY WILL NOT BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AFTER THE ABOVE MARKET POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT EXPIRES IN 2018. IN ORDER FOR THE MRC MISSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND AFFORDABLE MSW TO CONTINUE BEYOND 2018, IT BECAME NECESSARY TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT AN ALTERNATIVE DISPOSAL OPTION TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE MRC MEMBERSHIP BEYOND 2018. THE MRC HAS PROCEEDED WITH SPONSORSHIP OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FACILITY TO MANAGE MSW ORIGINATING IN ITS MEMBER MUNICIPALITIES AFTER THE EXISTING DISPOSAL AGREEMENTS EXPIRE EARLY IN 2018. TO THIS END, THE MRC HAS PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING IN 2015: SELECTED AS MOST ADVANTAGEOUS A DEVELOPER OF AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY, FIBERIGHT, INC. (FIBERIGHT), THAT WOULD OWN AND MANAGE DESIGN, PERMITTING, FINANCING, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE NEW FACILITY ON A SITE TO BE SECURED BY THE MRC.

NEGOTIATED A FORM OF JOINDER AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO EACH CHARTER MUNICIPALITY AS A CONTRACTUAL BASIS FOR PROVIDING MSW TO THE FACILITY IN HAMPDEN FOR AN INITIAL TERM OF 15 YEARS STARTING ON APRIL 1, 2018. THE FORM OF JOINDER AGREEMENT PROVIDES A BASIS FOR ALLOCATION OF ALL OF THE CASH ASSETS OF THE EQUITY CHARTER MUNICIPALITIES AS OF APRIL 1, 2018. UNDER THAT ALLOCATION, 5.0 MILLION WOULD BE USED TO PURCHASE AND DEVELOP THE HAMPDEN SITE. THE REMAINING FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT THE ANTICIPATED MSW PROCESSING AND DISPOSAL ARRANGEMENTS GOING FORWARD FOR THOSE CHARTER MUNICIPALITIES THAT ENTER INTO JOINDER AGREEMENTS. THE ALLOCABLE SHARE OF SUCH FUNDS WOULD BE RETURNED TO EQUITY CHARTER MUNICIPALITIES THAT DO NOT ENTER IN JOINDER AGREEMENTS. THE MRC'S EXPENSES TO SUPPORT SUCH DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY RESERVES HELD IN THE MRC OPERATING BUDGET STABILIZATION FUND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PERMITTED USES OF SUCH FUNDS.

"Opera Maine had a landmark season in 2022 in presenting The Flying Dutchman, the first opera by Richard Wagner ever performed in the state. Originally planned for 2020, the production was designed to honor Maine's Bicentennial. The drama unfolded on the coast of Maine in 1820, with sets and costumes authentic to both place and period, thanks to a collaboration with Maine Maritime Museum and the research help of other institutions. With a large orchestra and a cast of international stars, The Flying Dutchman represented a full return to pre-pandemic production standards. Everyone in volved in the production followed strict pandemic protocols throughout the rehearsal and performance periods. Although attendance at Merrill Auditorium exceeded that of 2021, it represented about 62% of average pre-pandemic audience levels, demonstrating that some members of the public were still reluctant to gather together in large indoor spaces. The Flying Dutchman received positive reviews in both local and national press. Opera Maine's Studio Artist Program (SAP) continues to offer singers who are just beginning professional careers the opportunity to perform all roles in the company's secondary opera production. In 2022, the Studio Artists presented two live performances of The Fall of the House of Usher, a contemporary opera by Philip Glass. Opera Maine maintained the production values set in 2021 by performing the work with a 13-piece orchestra, also comprised of emerging young artists, and by staging the work with video projections. Attendance exceeded that of the 2021 SAP opera, and the performance was also available as a live stream, which was viewed 748 times in a two-week period. For the first time, an Opera Maine SAP production was reviewed in the local press. Studio Artists also presented a concert and participated as choristers and role covers in The Flying Dutchman. Community Programs: Opera for All is Opera Maine's multi-faceted initiative to make opera inclusive and accessible to everyone in our community. This is achieved through a combination of free educational programming in public schools, free tickets to professional opera performances provided to members of our local community, and free community lectures, conversations, and workshops. To prepare audiences for Opera Maine's summer season, Dramaturg Calien Lewis gave the following presentations: two talks about the operas at the Portland Public Library, one talk at Curtis Memorial Library in Brunswick, a class at the University of Southern Maine on the history of opera, and two classes, one on German opera and one on The Flying Dutchman, for the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute. Prior to each Opera Maine performance, Ms. Lewis gave a pre-show talk as a way of enhancing the audience experience. Free tickets to productions were provided to over 300 people (mostly those under 25 and active and retired military and first responders). In=school programming reached over 300 students in five public middle and high schools across the state.

"Energy Efficiency and Building Decarbonization:Acadia Center is transforming the region's building systems to make them more efficient and healthier. The project seeks to advance energy efficiency programs that provide incentives and support to consumers to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses, shifting billions of utility dollars from purchasing power plant contracts into energy efficiency programs including through state energy efficiency planning bodies across the region as well as through emerging policy concepts such as Clean Heat Standards (CHS). The project focuses on transitioning buildings to clean, efficient, all-electric heating and cooling systems and pursues this work through coalitions, state policies, a building-science approach, and innovative methods that make energy efficiency programs easier for consumers to participate in, specifically in environmental justice, rural and other historically underserved communities. These efforts encompass improving weatherization and addressing pre-weatherization barriers for the region's aging building stock, driving flexible loads and grid-interactive buildings, and synchronizing in-building electrification strategies with broader community- and neighborhood-level solutions like networked geothermal. The project further works to sustain and advance energy efficiency as a resource at a regional level, where it contributes some 12-14% of the region's power needs. Clean Energy and Infrastructure:Acadia Center advocates for accelerating the deployment of clean energy on the power grid, from large-scale resources like offshore wind to local, distributed renewables like community and rooftop solar. This work extends to the complex area of reforms to remove barriers to clean power in the regional electricity grid, where our goals include articulating the consumer, health, environmental justice, and climate case against persistent reliance on fossil fuel for electricity in the region. In addition to overarching reform work, the organization has initiated a suite of new grid- and infrastructure-focused projects intended to improve the responsiveness of power grids to consumer, climate, and equity goals. These include creating a forum for northeast regional grid planning across New England, New York, and eastern Canada; a set of analyses on the barriers to and solutions for harmonious siting and community engagement around large-scale grid infrastructure projects; and a novel effort to plug municipalities into the important work of the regional grid operator and help them shape outcomes there to advance local and state policy priorities.Clean Energy:Shifting electric power generation to zero and low-carbon resources is central to Acadia Center's core program work. As building and transportation sectors electrify, securing renewables and clean energy resources on the grid is vital to ensuring adequate renewable supply to keep pace with rising demand, power vehicles and heat pumps with clean electrons, and deliver economic and public health benefits to local communities. Acadia Center is focused on accelerating the deployment of diverse renewable resources that are and will be part of an optimized renewable portfolio for the region, including offshore wind, onshore wind, utility-scale solar, community solar, rooftop solar, clean hydropower, and beyond. The program undertakes policy advocacy and market reforms needed to remove barriers and spur adoption at the local, state, and regional levels from renewable portfolio standards to net energy metering rules, solar incentive programs, and large-scale procurements.Acadia Center has long advocated for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) program, which has delivered over $6 billion in funds to invest in clean energy and consumer benefits in 11 participating states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region. We lead regional advocacy calls on RGGI, develop recommendations to the states and RGGI, Inc., and prepare analyses and reports on both the program's benefits and ways to improve it.Clean Grid:Acadia Center has long played an important advocacy role before ISO-NE, NEPOOL, and their respective stakeholder committees and bodies, such as the Consumer Liaison Group (CLG). In conjunction with this work, the organization launched a new Communities and Clean Grid project focused on providing energy education resource material about the power grid to municipalities in the region. The objective of this project is to equip and empower local communities to understand better and potentially engage in and influence deliberative ISO New England grid planning and management processes, aiming to 1) place local communities on an equal footing with other stakeholders seeking to influence ISO-NE grid planning and management, and 2) enlist them in the region-wide effort to implement equitable, affordable clean energy solutions.Northeast Grid Planning Forum:The Northeast Grid Planning Forum (NGPF) is a deliberative stakeholder dialogue designed to formalize and deepen collaboration across northeast U.S. states and Canadian provinces around interregional energy systems and grid coordination. Acadia Center and Nergica, independent US and Canada-based non-profit corporations serve as co-convenors for this effort. The dialogue will be convened via three distinct roundtable processes: 1) environmental justice and community mobilization, 2) interregional planning, and 3) clean energy procurement and market development. Interregional grid coordination in this context includes a range of planning, investment, market design, community benefits, and operational approaches. Northeast states already share electrical connections with their Canadian neighbors, but a more holistic approach to planning and implementing improvements to the regional energy system will deliver significant value to New England ratepayers.Infrastructure and Community Engagement:Acadia Center is addressing the issue that to meet climate goals successfully, a large increase in renewable generation will require sufficient transmission and other infrastructure to be built. That increase will occur when communities and stakeholders value and support infrastructure development. This will require improvements in permitting processes to be inclusive and trustworthy of community and stakeholder participation. One near-term project Acadia Center is undertaking to understand better community needs in infrastructure siting and permitting is a partnership with colleagues at the Clean Air Task Force (CATF). Acadia Center and CATF are working together to design and understand better and help overcome barriers to the responsible siting and development of clean infrastructure in the region, including barriers related to community engagement and needs in permitting and siting processes. Utility Innovation and Accountability: Acadia Center advances thought-leading reforms in state and regional utility regulation so all parties engaged in the energy system utilities, regulators, and consumers work together to achieve shared goals. The program builds awareness about how outdated financial incentives influence utility decision-making and can misalign with clean energy deployment, climate goals, and ratepayer benefits. The program has significant reforms of public utility commissions and state regulatory oversight so that they consider climate impacts and equity imperatives alongside reliability, affordability, and safety. Program goals seek to catalyze modernization of the grid and the utility system of the future, with a focus on performance-based regulation, utility performance incentive mechanisms, rate-design for electrification and DERS, integrated distribution system planning (gas/electric), non-wires alternatives, and inclusive stakeholder engagement. Climate Policy and Solutions:Every program and project at Acadia Center touches on climate policy and solutions. Climate Policy represents a dedicated set of activities specifically focused on addressing opportunities for states and the region to achieve overarching climate targets, which require deep, economy-wide decarbonization and phaseout of the use of fossil fuels. Program area activities include engaging with states on comprehensive climate planning studies, modeling, and energy system strategies. This work advances long-term, """"big picture thinking,"""" which is needed to ensure that comprehensive and cohesive strategies for decarbonizing entire economies are considered. Climate Policy includes work in Acadia Center's CLEAN-E Analysis team. It embraces three project areas that are essential to the achievement of near- and long-term climate targets at a state and regional level: 1) Fossil Fuel Phase-Out, and 2) State and Regional Climate Policies, which includes work on programs that set binding caps on emissions (e.g., RGGI, cap-and-invest).Climate, Energy, and Equity Analysis (CLEAN-E):Acadia Center develops analytic materials and independent, thought-leading recommendations across various clean energy and climate issues. Work products created by our Climate, Energy, and Equity Analysis program include 1) comprehensive, proactive reports, 2) analytically focused comments to government agencies and filings with regulatory bodies, and 3) rapid response offense/defense analysis. In recent years, we have produced groundbreaking reports about building electrification, the RGGI program, and issues around claims for clean fuels. Work performed in 2023 includes comprehensive assessments of the climate impacts of fuels such as hydrogen and """"renewable natural gas; in-depth analyses of technical issues related to shaping an effective Clean Heat Standard for building decarbonization; and original research that found sizeable public health impacts of smaller fossil fuel powerplants that fall under the radar in policy arenas.Fossil Fuel Phase-Out:To meet climate goals, the region must almost entirely phase out its use of fossil gas, commonly referred to as natural gas and other fossil fuels. Acadia Center seeks to replace fossil gas with clean energy alternatives in electricity production, building heating, and transportation. This conversion necessarily requires the downsizing and decommissioning fossil fuel infrastructure and supply chain networks, such as gas distribution system transition. This project advances proposals to level the playing field for renewables and efficient electric technologies and shrink the reliance on fossil fuels across the region and all program areas. As the electric sector faces an approaching need to develop and deploy dispatchable, emissions-free resources (DEFR) such as long-duration storage, green hydrogen, and other potential resources, Acadia Center is engaging closely on the question of how to address reliability and resource adequacy role currently served by fossil fuels, including reliance on dual-fuel oil/gas and LNG resources for winter reliability.Transportation and Mobility:Acadia Center accelerates the transition to low-carbon transportation. We advance policy approaches that address transportation emissions and invest in equitable access to clean mobility solutions, including solutions that specifically focus on disproportionate impacts and gaps in service in underserved urban and rural communities. The solutions we promote range from electric vehicles and zero-emission buses and trucks to transit, rail, and biking/walking infrastructure, among other measures to reduce emissions and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). We strive to help states evolve the way they and their DOTs plan for and invest in their traditional transportation assets to a model that is compatible with emissions reduction requirements while also ensuring that the region's construction workforces see a vibrant future even as funding is shifted away from, e.g., highway expansion projects. Our vision also includes place-based decarbonization interventions at key hubs within the region's transportation system, including ports, freight terminals, and airports. After the Transportation and Climate Initiative's (TCI) cessation, Acadia Center continues to coordinate advocates working on transportation and equity issues. It may resume focusing on the potential for cap-and-invest to drive equitable transportation emissions reductions through broader economywide models.Equity and Environmental Justice:Embedded across Acadia Center's work is addressing climate and clean energy policies and solutions designed to improve the lives of all residents and specifically redress the detrimental impacts of a fossil fuel economy on lower-income urban and rural communities. Acadia Center internally applies diversity, equity, and environmental justice through staff discussions, materials, approaches, and engagement. Programs seek to connect and build relationships with community-based organizations and diverse stakeholders to improve energy system decisions and planning to be inclusive and responsive to community needs. These efforts seek to place and keep environmental justice solutions at the forefront of state and regional initiatives that formerly overlooked this vital imperative.Communications and Public Engagement:A core focus of Acadia Center's approach to climate is to consider how the organization's program efforts should resonate with decision-makers, media, communities, and the broader public. To those goals, program work includes developing educational and explanatory materials that raise awareness about the benefits of a clean energy economy in accessible, digestible formats. Using top-notch graphic design, these innovative materials connect clean energy and climate progress with issues of concern to the public's daily lives, such as economic prosperity, equity, health, quality of life, and climate benefits. Acadia Center staff participate in numerous public forums and produce original analyses and reports. In 2023, the organization launched a new Climate and Energy Explainer Series that has addressed complex issues that the organization is addressing in its program work, such as clean energy technologies available on the power grid, the lifecycle implications of claims for """"renewable natural gas; what a Clean Heat Standard is and why it can be a powerful building decarbonization tool if done correctly and other topics. The Climate and Energy Explainer Series will continue with monthly reports throughout 2024.",0,"The summary focuses on energy efficiency, clean energy, and environmental justice without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"In 2011, PopTech continued to be a key global participant in the field of social innovation. The October 2011 PopTech Conference - The World Rebalancing - explored how the global community is rebalancing economically, ecologically, culturally, demographically and geopolitically. We also explored the juxtaposition of a world marked by almost constant volatility and uncertainty and one that has seen transformational power of individuals and small groups and the emergence of a truly global culture in where the voice of a few inspires and reaches many. In 2011 PopTech continued its trajectory as a key global participant in the field of social innovation. Our programming provides education, leadership training and solution-generating convenings addressing a variety of global and societal issues and challenges. PopTech's Social Innovation Fellows and Science Fellows programs represent core mission commitments of PopTech. The programs were founded in 2008 and 2010 respectively. The goal of the programs is to accelerate the impact of future leaders and edge innovators through training in leadership, communications/storytelling and engagement and skill building in areas such as negotiation, fundraising, marketing, brand promise, human capital management and design for impact. In addition to training, the programs provide a rich environment of supportive immersion that promotes peer-to-peer mentoring. This environment is intentional and sets the stage for the development of collaborative partnerships.There have been 60 Social Innovation Fellows to date, and 28 Science Fellows. The Fellows operate in more than 60 countries around the world, and their work has impacted the lives of more than an estimated 300 million people.The Fellows programs are extremely competitive and have an increasing global reach. In 2011 we saw a 54% increase in nominations (336) and a 60% increase in geographic spread of nominations (57 countries) over previous years.PopTech Initiatives such as PeaceTXT, announced in 2010, are exemplar of our ability to facilitate unconventional cross-sector collaboration. PeaceTXT is exploring the role of mobile technology in the development of an integrated, globally deployable platform aimed at changing community norms around violent behavior, and as a violence interruption and crisis intervention tool when violence does erupt. The PeaceTXT collaborative team includes some of the worlds leading experts in violence interruption, mobile technology and crisis mapping. Current partners include PopTech, CeaseFire, Medic Mobile, Ushahidi, Praekelt Foundation and Kenya-based Sis ni Amani, as well as several other technical and funding partners. In 2012 PeaceTXT will be launching a series of pilots in Kenya to test the effectiveness of mobile messaging campaigns in lowering the potential of political violence in the run-up to Kenya's next national election. PopTech continues to explore unique areas of global interest through PopTech Labs. In February 2012 the organization will convene 30 experts of diverse background in Nairobi, Kenya for the Climate Resilience Lab. The convening will explore innovation at the intersection of community resilience and adaptation strategies through a gender lens that recognizes the disproportionate effect climate change will have on women and young girls, particularly in rural areas of the developing world. In September of 2012 we will facilitate the Networks of Abundance Lab that will focus on the future of the Internet and access to the broadband network that makes access to the power of the Internet possible. The questions that frame our conversation include: What broadband access actually is and thus what the future of broadband could be. Is access a human right? A public utility? A pay service like cable television or mobile phones? Or is it something wholly different and as yet undefined? Updates and reports from PopTech Labs can be found at http://poptech.org/labs.Finally, in 2011 PopTech continued to produce and distribute high-quality media, including video podcasts of conference speakers, Social Innovation Fellows, and project updates. We have seen significant growth in our social media followers and a steady increase in website visits and views of our online content. Through these activities and more, PopTech is gaining increasing global recognition as a leading participant in the field of social innovation.",0,"The summary focuses on social innovation, education, and community engagement without any mention of religious concepts or faith-based motivations."

We work with young people statewide who face uphill battles on their way to college, and we level the playing field for them by providing financial resources and a broad range of supports. Each year, the Institute selects at least one graduating senior from every public high school in Maine. In 2023, we awarded 166 graduating seniors a $10,000 scholarship each. Scholarship selection is based on academic excellence, community leadership, and financial need.(Continued on Schedule O)The 166 scholarships awarded in 2023 was 20 more than the previous year. In addition to the $10,000 scholarship, the Institute provides support including personal and professional development programming, opportunities for additional funding for internships and study abroad, and access to a network that provides lasting relationships and career advice. Since our founding in 1995, the Mitchell Institute has awarded more than $25 million in scholarship, fellowship, and contingency funds to more than 3,600 Scholars and Alumni who hail from every community in Maine. Our data shows that the more we engage with Mitchell Scholars, the more likely they are to graduate: 88% of Mitchell Scholars complete college and achieve a degree, compared with 58% of students nationally. 89% of Mitchell Scholar Alumni are working in career-related jobs-nearly two-thirds of them in Maine. While 44% of recent Mitchell Scholars were the first in their families to attend college and 80% came from households earning less than Maine's median family income, over 50% achieved earnings early in their careers that were higher than their entire family household income at the time they applied for the Mitchell Scholarship.",0,The summary focuses on providing scholarships and support for education without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts.

Please see the following excerpt from the Northern Light Health Annual Report 2023 to the Community for details of community benefit projects at NLH members:Northern Light HealthAnnual Report 2023HOW ARE YOU?How are you is a simple question that we ask many times throughout the day, but its also a question that goes beyond conversation, an expression of genuine care and interest in the wellbeing of others. Its a foundation of the deeper, more meaningful relationships we build with our employees, patients, community members, and others. We hope this annual report illustrates how this question, while at the heart of our character, is one of the ways we guide our patients and their families through the healthcare experience. This year, we highlight ways our incredible employees and community partners work together to ensure we are making healthcare work for all people in Maine. From a nurse who provides healing care in the hospital and nourishing food in a restaurant, to helping community members combat opioid use disorder with Narcan training.Our commitment extends well beyond the walls of our facilities; we are training community organizations in psychological first aid and are collaborating with our local communities to promote health education and help create a healthier Maine. We extend our gratitude to our dedicated staff and community partners, and to the people of Maine who place their trust in us.

Dentry, MBAPresident & CEONorthern Light HealthJohn RyanBoard ChairNorthern Light HealthHOW ARE YOUGOING TO SAVE A LIFE?Northern Light Healths Narcan Program: Saving Lives in Maine Andrew Mitchell found himself in a situation he never expected. He was outside a restaurant in Bangor one August afternoon in 2022 when a life changing experience convinced him of the importance of the overdose-reversing medication, Narcan. Mitchell, who received a Narcan kit at the Blue Hill Fair, was out with a friend when a woman across the street urgently called out that a man was overdosing. Quickly, Mitchell rushed to his truck, grabbed the Narcan kit, and administered the life-saving drug to the unconscious man, whose lips had turned blue. Thanks to his timely intervention, the man began to regain consciousness. Mitchell received his free Narcan kit from Northern Light Blue Hill Hospital, which has been at the forefront of addressing Maines opioid epidemic. Employees handed out these kits to the public at the Blue Hill Fair in 2022 and 2023. Mitchell shares, I had no medical training at all, and if I can use Narcan, anyone else can use it too. Its straightforward, he shares. Northern Light Healths efforts extend beyond Narcan distribution to individuals. Hospitals across the system are engaging the community in a new and meaningful way. Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville and Northern Light Sebasticook Valley Hospital in Pittsfield provide training to community organizations on the use of Narcan. The hospitals training programs are part of a three-year federal grant program to reduce overdose deaths in Maine. Hanna Bouchard, a community health outreach coordinator with both hospitals, plays a vital role in this program. Her experience as an emergency medical technician, coupled with her dedication to the cause has made her a key figure in providing Narcan training to community partners, including Kennebec Valley Community College in Fairfield. This program is not just about teaching people how to use Narcan; its about giving them the knowledge and tools to save lives, shares Bouchard. In the battle against opioid overdoses, data tells a compelling story. Maine experienced more than 700 overdose deaths in 2022, and while the numbers are alarming, Narcan is making a difference. Of the 9,394 reported non-fatal overdoses, 2,200 were reversed thanks to community members carrying Narcan. Now with Food and Drug Administration approval, this life-saving medication is available over the counter. Across Maine, the opioid crisis remains a significant challenge. These initiatives, whether distributing Narcan kits at the Blue Hill Fair or providing community trainings, are crucial steps towards reducing drug overdose deaths. These programs serve as beacons of hope, reminding us that every life is worth saving, and every intervention counts. A Vital Connection Are you monitoring your health? Northern Light Home Care & Hospice is one of the first home healthcare agencies to endorse and promote telehealth for patients who qualify. Through LiveConnected, Northern Lights telehealth program, monitors can be installed in a patients home. Our nurses train patients on how to read and record the information to monitor their condition, and the machine does the rest! More than 630 Mainers statewide use LiveConnected, including those who are not patients of Home Care & Hospice.The service uses monitoring equipment to provide daily readings of vital signs to registered nurses. The nurses work with the patient and their physician to maintain and adjust medications from the convenience of home. Each day at a pre-determined time, the machine guides the patient through the steps to monitor their health.Northern Light Home Care & Hospice uses a team approach to deliver care, educate our patients, and to better manage conditions like chronic heart and lung diseases. Often, managing chronic health conditions means frequent trips to the doctor or hospital to monitor vital signs. Using telemonitoring and offering care, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech language pathology to patients at home eliminates the stress of frequent trips and difficult access to transportation. Each Northern Light Home Care & Hospice patient receives a customized care plan that includes clinical home visits, telehealth monitoring, and education designed for the individual, allowing patients to manage their care from the comfort of home.

HOW ARE YOUAND YOUR BABY?Transforming Lives: Francis Warde Home For decades, Portland has been a destination for people seeking asylum; leaving their home countries, seeking safety and protection in a new place to call home. Sometimes, there are cracks in the social safety net for this vulnerable population, and some of the most vulnerable are pregnant women.One woman, who came to Northern Light Mercy Hospital on a cold rainy day in June, was five months pregnant, without shelter, and in dire need of care. Melissa Skahan, vice president of Mission Integration at Mercy, recounts her story, This woman was ill, had no home, and a discharge plan would potentially put her back out on the street or into another short-term shelter.Thankfully, Skahan was already working on a solution. Mercy Hospital had recently teamed up with the non-profit In Her Presence (IHP), to start a new, two-generational program for pregnant women who are seeking asylum. The new program would open soon, in the former Francis Warde Convent, a residence once owned by the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas and named after one of the original Sisters of Mercy.The Francis Warde Home was nearly ready to open, so instead of sending this pregnant woman back into uncertainty, hospital staff stepped in. Within 48 hours, they made a crucial decision that would change her life. Skahan adds, Our staff kept her here, and the program launch was timed so that we were able to move her quickly into Francis Warde.The Francis Warde program, as it is commonly referred to, ensures that vulnerable women in need of shelter, basic needs, and healthcare receive support. Overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Francis Warde program is Claudette Ndayininahaze, the co-founder and executive director of IHP. Ndayininahaze emphasizes, We are just beginning to understand how to see the whole person and serve the whole person. The IHP approach is creating long-term community and lifelong learners who give back. We need to integrate culture and ensure a true balance of power so that women from all over the world feel empowered to shape their healthcare.The program goes beyond providing shelter and healthcare. It extends to offering educational opportunities, including English language classes and workforce training at Northern Light Mercy Hospital. The women who benefit from the program go through a remarkable transformation.In Skahans words, Its transformative. Ive seen people who have been in the program for a few months, and they look like different people than when you first meet them because their basic needs are met, and they are constantly progressing and developing.The Francis Warde Home empowers those who have experienced hardship and displacement to influence their interactions with healthcare. The model reflects the specific needs of immigrant women and their children across the continuum of care. Through this program, Mercy Hospital, in partnership with IHP, is creating a healthier, more inclusive society where vulnerable individuals can thrive. Other collaborating agencies in this endeavor include Community Housing of Maine, JTG Foundation, Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, and the State of Maine.Our Climate Health PledgeHow can we Improve our Planets Health?We know that climate change can translate into poorer health outcomes for people across the planet and right here in Maine. To create a healthier environment for everyone, Northern Light Health has pledged to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In 2021, we began to gather data on things like direct emissions related to our use of heating fuels, vehicles, and even anesthetic gases.We also looked at indirect emissions from our electricity usage. Weve converted to electric vehicles, built more energy efficient hospitals, and began outsourcing our electricity from more renewable sources. In year one of our pledge, weve already reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by more than ten percent! We know there is a long way to go, but were pleased that we are off to such a positive start!We have some exciting new projects planned for 2024 including improvements to our supply chain, a food waste program, and a new podcast series on climate sustainability.To learn more, visit Northernlighthealth.org/SustainabilityHOW ARE YOUSHARING YOUR CULTURE?A Journey of Nursing and NourishingIts just before 9 am when Hope Moneke and one of her daughters arrive in Veazie, a suburb of Bangor, to start cooking for their restaurant where they serve delicious African cuisine each Friday through a shared kitchen arrangement. Moneke and her family made the life-changing decision to move to Maine a decade ago, seeking new opportunities and a better life. With an innate desire to help people, Moneke went to school and became a nurse, something that was not easily accessible to her in Nigeria.Now, she works on a busy cardiac floor at Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center. Little did Moneke know that her journey would lead to the creation of a unique blend of cultures, where her roles as a nurse and a chef would intertwine to bring joy, comfort, and a taste of home to her new community. Like many new Mainers, Moneke and her family missed the food and flavors of home. This became an opportunity for Moneke to pursue her other great passion: cooking. Growing up in Nigeria, she had honed her culinary skills, and now she had the chance to share her culture through food. Monekes flexible nursing schedule allows her to dedicate time to both her patients and her restaurant. She works three days a week at the medical center, where she finds immense fulfillment caring for patients. This role as a nurse is not just a job for Moneke; its a calling.Monekes face lights up when she describes the joy she finds in patient care and how her culinary artistry is an extension of her nurturing spirit as a nurse. I feel a deep sense of accomplishment in caring for my patients, and then being able to share my culture with this community through food, says Moneke.For Moneke, both her roles, nurse, and chef, are intertwined. She is a healer in both settings and finds great satisfaction in serving and making a difference in peoples lives.Her gift is not just about the food she serves; its about the connections she creates and the joy she brings to those whose lives she touches. Her story is a reminder that no matter where we come from, we all share the common human experience of wanting to make a difference and finding fulfillment on our journeys. Moneke has achieved just that, with a warm smile and a plate full of delicious African cuisine.People come here, and they tell me my food is delicious, and thatmakes me very happy, says Moneke. I feel so proud of myself that I accomplished this, and I get to make a difference in peoples lives, that is the most important thing.",0,"The summary focuses on healthcare services, community support, and cultural integration without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"Waterfall Arts 2017 Programs and Accomplishments -- 990 Narrative ReportWaterfall Arts experienced continued growth in 2017, carrying on the upward trend continuously since the organization began in 2000. We were able to tally over 7700 visitors in 2017 -- a 51% increase over the previous year -- but many more come through the building uncounted, especially on Fridays in May-October, when the Farmers Market meets in our yard. ORGANIZATION Building on last years internal organizational development, this year we launched the quiet phase of a $1.75M capital campaign to address energy efficiency, accessibility, user-friendliness and aesthetics. A campaign committee was established, fundraising consultant engaged, and Business Plan and Case Statements were distributed to potential funders. The solicitation process is ongoing. Operations continued apace. The previous years budget growth to accommodate a new position stabilized and maintained this year, with six employees (positions range from 25-35 hours/week): a Marketing and Development Manager, a Youth and Family Outreach Coordinator, an Office Manager, the Co-Directors: Director of Programming and Director of Finance and Operations, and our Facilities Manager oversees the care and maintenance of our 80-year-old community center, a former elementary school. Twenty-five volunteers tend the gallery, manage the studios, coordinate exhibits, fundraise, perform office and marketing duties, and organize some of the events. The 13 board members participate in five working committees, held an annual retreat, and continued preparing for a capital campaign to improve the building for accessibility, energy efficiency, and consumer fulfillment. EXHIBITIONS Over 3100 individual visits were made into the Clifford Gallery, while many more saw the art in the Corridor Gallery. Seasonal exterior exhibits continue: the popular Living Wall, a vertical garden installed on the south wall May-September, a joint project with local students; and the Willow Dome on the front lawn. We were also honored to display a number of large colorful metal sculpture by Bayside resident Jim Wolfe on the exterior of the building, starting in the fall of 2016, through April 2017. 2017 EXHIBITION DESCRIPTIONS In House Jan 27 - Feb 24 Corridor GalleryWork by the denizens of Waterfall Arts will grace the walls of the corridors -- people who make art in the building in their studios or our classrooms, who work and volunteer for WA, studio subscribers, and our teaching artists. Young Artists Gallery Takeover Mar 3 - April 1 Corridor and Clifford GalleriesAn annual open call exhibition that includes over 250 works by youth aged 4-18 from area public schools, alternative schools, homeschooling groups, and other young members of the community. Students in Bridge, the after school art club, assist in organizing the event and prepare the work, including their own, for exhibition. Home -- Open Call Show April 7 - May 12 Corridor and Clifford GalleriesExperienced and novice artists from all over are invited to submit work under the theme home, referencing the familiar, the safe places in our lives -- physical spaces, landscapes, bodies and buildings, places where we and other species grew up -- as well as refuges of the mind and heart, the mental and spiritual spaces in which we thrive. Seesaw: Anna Hepler and Karen Gelardi May 26 - July 21 Clifford Gallery, Corridor and Exterior WallFor more than a decade Maine artists Karen Gelardi and Anna Hepler have worked together, sharing an interest in textiles, and printmaking, and making work that crosses the boundaries between two and three-dimensions. Seesaw will highlight their rich and intertwined language of form, surface, and process with sculptures made from ceramic, fabric, paper, and images both sewn and printed. Now based at opposite ends of the Maine coastline, with Belfast as a perfect mid-point between their studios, this exhibition explores the parallel and overlapping evolution of their work. Interiors July 28 - September 15 Clifford GalleryThis show is a curated collection of works that focus on representations of domestic spaces. The owners presence is clearly felt, but the human form is not the central idea; the work shows the interior spaces we occupy, rather than us in them. Artists include Alison Rector, Louise Bourne, Gideon Bok, Sarah Swajkos, David Estey, Jessica Ives, and Heath Paley. Arrival: Work by and about New Mainers September 22 - November 17 Clifford GalleryThis exhibition showcases work by and about artists who have arrived here, make their home here, are the New Mainers, and bring traditions/identities that are from other cultures, other countries, and who are mostly non-white. Were challenging the notion of a Mainer, and also a New Mainer. They range from recent immigrants to long-time naturalized citizens, and their diverse journeys and arrival in Maine are defining factors in their lives and their art. Included will be portraits by Portland-based French artist Orson Horchler of recent immigrants, and works by Ali Asgar, Edwige Charlot, Asherah Cinnamon, Titi de Baccarat, Rosalba Brazeale, Damir Porobic, Sze Wing Wong, and others. Our Sense of Home September 22 November 17 Corridor GalleryMaine artist Susan Smith focuses on socially engaged projects, and she will coordinate a community-generated installation of mass produced house forms, which will be distributed throughout the area to local schools, colleges, homeless service centers, food banks, nursing homes and libraries. Participants will take the basic cardboard house form and create art pieces to craft their interpretation of home, with the option of providing accompanying text. Materials will be on site throughout the exhibition so visitors can add to the installation. Handmade: Annual Affordable Art Show and Sale December 1 23 Clifford GalleryOur curated, highly popular arts and craft extravaganza, we display new work from over 100 contemporary crafters and artists, perfect for gift giving and receiving. EVENTS A total of 38 public events took place, some in conjunction with exhibits such as artist talks, or hands-on art demo nights, and at least 10 were specifically all-ages events. Ten were in partnership with other area organizations, such as the Belfast Poetry Festival or the All Roads Music Festival. Several events -- the annual Glow Show and the opening of the annual Handmade holiday show sale -- drew well over 200 people each. Overall, 3444 people attended events throughout the year. ART EDUCATION Educational programming grew as well. We gave classes in clay, hot glass, painting, printmaking of various types, and more for all ages; 57 were offered by 24 different teachers, with an admirable 72% meeting enrollment minimums. Over 440 students of all ages participated, almost exactly the same as last year. The Youth and Family Outreach program remains very busy, attracting new young people and their families. The afterschool art program is 3 afternoons per week: Bridge, free for 6th graders (who have no art in the local school), low-cost Bridge Jr, for 4th and 5th graders; and pay-what-you-can Teen Art Studio, for grades 7-12. Students volunteer at the Art Tent, installed at public venues and festivals around town, as well as at our All Ages Art Happenings (AAAHs) such as the annual Glow Show, or the Big Draw. Art Together Mornings are held monthly on Saturdays for kids and their parents to make art side by side. Outreach efforts brought our staff to present workshops at outlying Waldo County towns, as well as brought two school groups here for field trips. Waterfall Arts continued to offer scholarships to enable people of all means to participate in our programs. A grant from United Mid-Coast Charities and the Norton Fund (managed by us) allowed 29 students to attend from all over the county. FACILITY The Youth Art Studio -- the Bridge Studio -- is on the first floor, giving them their own self-enclosed working classroom. This move made for much more visibility for this program, and allowed for better use/availability of the public rental spaces -- the Dance Annex and the Fall Out Shelter in the basement. The longstanding Life Drawing group is in the Dance Annex on Saturdays, and the dedicated public studios -- Print, Darkroom, and Ceramics -- were available and utilized by the public through subscriptions. Waterfall Arts offers longterm studio rentals to artists, musicians, and creative economy entrepreneurs. Rental income is 25% of our revenue. In 2017, we had 100% occupancy all year of the 16 long term studios. Short term, or one-time event, rentals are available to the public and space was used by many different groups including a weekly fiddlers group, martial arts, and dance instructors, workshops, music shows and performances, and educational events.",0,"The summary focuses on arts programming, community events, and educational activities without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."
"Primary Care Medical Services: While we had to temporarily suspend our weekly clinics due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continued to support our patients through telephone and virtual means until we could make the necessary adjustments to re-open our clinic to in-person visits. Even so, we held 37 clinics with 379 patients visits in 2020. Each session is staffed by 2 or 3 providers, 2 nurses, a social worker or counselor, and a receptionists as well as a greeter/escort for COVID screening. Our usual volunteers who offer such services as massage therapy, stress reduction, physical therapy, acupuncture, respiratory therapy were limited by the pandemic. The clinic is held in space donated by another medical practice located in the same building as our business offices. Staffing of the medical clinic was provided largely by volunteers. Estimated value of patient services provided: $75,188. Estimated value of donated professional services: $49,958. Estimated value of donated space & support: $29,700. Preventative/Restorative Dental Care: This program was significantly ipacted by the pandemic, necessitating closing the offices until appropriate modification could be done to allow for safely continuing services. Even so, we had 534 hygiene visits with 86 of them children. In addition, we had 274 visits with a dentist, and 21 of those were children. We also completed 9 denture cases. Hygienist services are provided by our own employees using our own equipment in donated space. The clinic subsidizes the cost of restorative services provided through an unaffiliated dental practice. Other services are provided by independent volunteer dentists. Estimated value of patient services provided: $164,280. Estimated value of donated professional services: $122,880. Estimated value of donated space and support: $54,000. Prescription Assistance: This program along provided services valued at $1,412,268 in 2020 by working with patients and other medical practices to obtain free medications through programs offered by pharmaceutical companies. We have served over 1750 patients over the years with61 new patients in 2020. Of the active patients, 31% are from our own medical practice and 68% from other providers. In addition, we have helped many clients with medication not available through these programs by providing information on pricing alternatives and through coupons. We've also helped folks through the application process for the insurance marketplace, gathered and given away other personal supplied and food items through local gleanings. This program is operated by a single, part-time employee. Estimated value of services provided: $1,412,268. Estimated value of donated space and services: $8,300. Health and Wellness Program: We provide counseling and referral services for behavioral health including stress reduction and short-term mental health counseling. This program was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic which increased the needs, decreased the availability of volunteers due to their experiencing higher demands, and necessitated adapting with virtual telehealth sessions. Even so, we provided 173 patient visits, with most provided by paid staff. Estimated value of services provided: $24,480. Estimated value of donated provider services: $6,350. Estimated value of donated space and supporting services: $7,500.",0,The summary focuses on healthcare services and does not mention any religious or faith-based concepts.

THE MAIN GOAL IS TO CREATE ANIMOSITY TOWARDS ISRAEL AND ITS SUPPORTERS. (CONTINUED ON SCH. O)SOME EXAMPLES OF RELENTLESS CAMPAIGNS BY ANTI-ISRAEL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDE THE CALLS FOR BOYCOTTING ONLY ISRAEL, THE RALLIES SUPPORTING HAMAS TERRORISM AND/OR CALLING FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST ISRAELIS AND/OR ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS ISRAEL, PROMOTION OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT ISRAEL AND/OR JEWS, AND HOLOCAUST DENIAL OR HOLOCAUST INVERSION (ACCUSING JEWS OF BEING NAZIS). ALL OF THESE RACIST TACTICS ARE MENACING TO JEWISH PEOPLE, TO ISRAEL AND TO NON-JEWISH PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT ISRAEL.THE SAME STRATEGIES AND TOOLS THAT STANDWITHUS IS USING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ARE ALSO BEING USED WITHIN COMMUNITIES.FOR 23 YEARS, STANDWITHUS HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN EDUCATING AND INSPIRING PEOPLE OF ALL AGES ABOUT ISRAEL AND ABOUT FIGHTING ANTISEMITISM.

ISRAEL AND ITS SUPPORTERS ARE REGULARLY BEING MARGINALIZED AND/OR """"CANCELED"""" ON CAMPUS AS THEY WERE ON BERKELEY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN 9 STUDENT GROUPS IN THE LAW SCHOOL VOTED ON A BYLAW THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW """"ZIONIST"""" SPEAKERS TO PRESENT TO THESE GROUPS. ITS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A ZIONIST SIMPLY BELIEVES THAT ISRAEL HAS A RIGHT TO EXIST IN PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE LOCATION OF THE ANCESTRAL HOMELAND OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE, AND MOST JEWS CONSIDER ISRAEL AN INTEGRAL PART OF THEIR JEWISH IDENTITY.

STUDENTS HAVE REPORTED HATE SPEECH AND ANTISEMITIC CAMPAIGNS BEING HOSTED ON THEIR CAMPUSES THROUGH SPEAKERS, PROFESSORS AND STUDENT GROUPS WHO CREATE ILL WILL ON CAMPUS FOR ISRAEL AND ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS IT.

"OVERVIEW AND SACRAMENTO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLOVERVIEWST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS (SHPS) OPENED ITS DOORS IN 2003 WITH A CLEAR VISION: TO CREATE ONE OF THE FINEST URBAN PRE-KINDERGARTEN THROUGH 12TH GRADE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS IN AMERICA. OUR STUDENTS ATTEND LONGER SCHOOL DAYS, ARE HELD TO HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR ACADEMICS AND BEHAVIOR AND FOCUS ON PREPARING TO OBTAIN A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OPERATES TRIUMPH CENTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, PS7 (K-8), OAK PARK PREP MIDDLE SCHOOL (7-8), AND SACRAMENTO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL (9-12).SACRAMENTO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLSACRAMENTO HIGH SCHOOL IS THE FINAL GATEWAY TO COLLEGE. IT IS ONE SCHOOL WITH FOUR THEMES, OR PATHWAYS-ARTS, BUSINESS AND COMMUNICATIONS, LAW AND PUBLIC SERVICE, MATH ENGINEERING AND HEALTH SCIENCES-IN A FULLY RENOVATED FACILITY THAT IS BRIGHT, AIRY AND OPEN. ALONG WITH CORE ACADEMICS, SAC HIGH HAS A CULTURE OF HIGH EXPECTATIONS, SCHOOL SPIRIT AND STUDENT LEADERSHIP. IT ALSO HAS A TIRELESSLY DEDICATED STAFF OR, AS ONE SENIOR PUT IT, """"WE JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT BREED OF TEACHER HERE."""" THE COLLECTIVE EFFORTS ARE EVIDENT IN MULTIPLE MEASURES. THE SCHOOL'S API HAS RISEN OVER 210 POINTS FROM 268 IN 2003 TO 780 IN 2013, MAKING THE SCHOOL THE HIGHEST PERFORMING OPEN-ENROLLMENT COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT. THIS IMPROVEMENT HAS OCCURRED WHILE THE DROPOUT RATE HAS DECREASED FROM OVER NINE PERCENT TO LESS THAN FOUR PERCENT AND SAC HIGH SAW THE HIGHEST GAINS IN READING OF ANY MIDDLE OR HIGH SCHOOL IN THE FOUR COUNTIES SURRONDING SACRAMENTO. FURTHERMORE, SAC HIGH DOES NOT JUST PROVIDE A HIGH-QUALITY EDUCATION; IT BRINGS TOGETHER THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ALL ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, TURNING THE DISTANT HOPE FOR COLLEGE INTO A TANGIBLE REALITY. THIS IS MOST EVIDENT IN THE FACT THAT OVER 90% OF SAC HIGH'S CLASS OF 2014 HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACCEPTED INTO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE, JUST ONE MONTH INTO THEIR SENIOR YEAR.WE PROVIDE A UNIQUE NETWORK OF SCHOOLS THAT GUIDES OUR STUDENTS FROM PRESCHOOL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE. STUDENTS GRADUALLY BUILD A FOUNDATION OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, COMMUNITY RESPONSIBILITY AND INNER CONFIDENCE EMPOWERING THEM TO BECOME EDUCATED LEADERS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. OUR RIGOROUS CURRICULUM HAS CLOSED THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES WHO GO ON TO COLLEGE.THE NATIONAL STATISTICS ARE DAUNTING: LESS THAN 40% OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS GO TO COLLEGE. BUT AT ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED, WE HAVE NOT ACCEPTED THAT FATE. IN 2011, OVER 70% OF OUR SENIORS WERE ACCEPTED TO MORE THAN 75 COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, UP FROM JUST 20% IN 2003 WHEN SAC HIGH WAS RUN AS A TRADITIONAL DISTRICT SCHOOL. OUR VISION IS THAT EVERY ONE OF OUR STUDENTS WILL LEAVE US PREPARED TO COMPLETE COLLEGE AND WE ARE WORKING RELENTLESSLY WITH OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES TOWARDS THIS GOAL. ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOL #7PS7 CONTINUES THE JOURNEY TO SUCCESS AT ST. HOPE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. PS7 HAS PRODUCED STUNNING RESULTS. IT IS RANKED AMONG THE TOP 10% OF SIMILAR SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS THE ONLY SCHOOL IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY NOMINATED FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS BLUE RIBBON AWARD IN 2010. WALK INTO ANY PS7 CLASSROOM AND THE SCENE IS THE SAME: A GROUP OF STUDENTS LEANING FORWARD, LISTENING INTENTLY AS A TEACHER ASKS QUESTIONS. THEN, A FLURRY OF HANDS ARE RAISED. THERE IS ARTWORK ON THE WALLS ALONG WITH A LIST OF EXPECTATIONS, CODES OF CONDUCT AND COMMITMENTS MADE. IF A CHILD AT PS7 DOES NOT PERFORM AT THE EXPECTED LEVELS, THAT STUDENT IS IDENTIFIED AND RE-TAUGHT UNTIL THEY HAVE MASTERED THE SKILL OR CONCEPT. NO CHILD FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS. NO CHILD IS LOST. AS A TESTAMENT TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS AND THE HARD WORK OF STAFF AND FAMILIES, PS7 WAS RANKED AS THE 8TH HIGHEST PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA AND WAS RECENTLY NAMED CHARTER SCHOOL OF THE YEAR FOR THE STATE. OAK PARK PREPARATORYOAK PARK PREP IS THE NEWEST SCHOOL IN THE ST. HOPE FAMILY AND HAS CONTINUED THE TRADITION SET BY THOSE THAT OPENED BEFORE IT. IN JUST THE SCHOOL'S FIRST YEAR OF OPERATION, OAK PARK PREP BECAME THE HIGHEST PERFORMING STAND ALONE MIDDLE SCHOOL IN THE SAC CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND SIXTH HIGHEST PERFORMING OVERALL. IN ADDITION, OAK PARK PREP IS THE FIRST STAND ALONE MIDDLE SCHOOL TO SERVE THE OAK PARK NEIGHBORHOOD IN 50 YEARS. TRIUMPH CENTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENTTRIUMPH PRESCHOOL SETS THE TONE FOR WHAT IS TO COME AT ST. HOPE. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHILDREN WHO ATTEND QUALITY PRESCHOOL HAVE STRONGER READING AND MATH SKILLS, ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE HELD BACK A GRADE, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AT TRIUMPH, CHILDREN BEGIN THE PATH TO BECOMING LIFE-LONG LEARNERS AND LEADERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO SERVING OTHERS. THE CLASSROOMS ARE ALIVE WITH HANDS-ON EXPLORATION AND LEARNING OF EVERY KIND, FROM RECITING POEMS TO PAINTING LETTERS WITH SHAVING CREAM. LESS THAN 25% OF TEACHERS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY PRESCHOOLS HOLD BACHELOR'S DEGREES, BUT EVERY TRIUMPH TEACHER HOLDS A FOUR-YEAR DEGREE OR HIGHER. ALONG WITH THE STAFF, FACULTY OF THE UC DAVIS HEALTH SYSTEM-INCLUDING A SPECIAL EDUCATION CONSULTANT, CHILD PSYCHIATRIST AND DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN-WORK WITH FAMILIES TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD'S INDIVIDUAL LEARNING NEEDS ARE MET. THE HIGHLY QUALIFIED STAFF AT TRIUMPH HAVE CREATED A REMARKABLE PROGRAM WIDELY RECOGNIZED FOR ITS SUCCESS IN RAISING STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENT. TRIUMPH IS ONE OF ONLY THREE SCHOOLS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO REACH THE STANDARDS SET BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE EDUCATION FOR YOUNG CHILDREN FOR """"HIGH QUALITY AND IN 2010-11 TRIUMPH WAS NAMED A MODEL SITE BY THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS WITH STUDENTS HAVING SEVERE AND PERVASIVE CHALLENGING BEHAVIOR. AS A RESULT, TRIUMPH HAS SHARED OUR BEST PRACTICES WITH TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS FROM INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOLS IN ELK GROVE UNIFIED AND SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL LOCAL HEADSTART PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, THE SCHOOL HAS CONTINUALLY SUSTAINED 95% FAMILY SATISFACTION EACH YEAR SINCE OPENING OUR DOORS.

This project also involves working closely with project partners in western Nevada County (Bicyclists of Nevada County, Bear Yuba Land Trust, and Gold Country Trails Council).Over the summer of 2019, TTF made changes and additions to Trail A1 (Jackass Ridge Trail). Recognizing the popularity of this trail and the opportunity for improvement, the TTF and United States Forest Service (USFS) agreed there was an excellent opportunity to systemize the trail. Systemization legally requires that the trail meet current sustainability standards and avoid identified sensitive areas. TTF raised funds to conduct necessary resource studies, and worked with the USFS to ensure sensitive resources are protected. This project involved the adoption of 1.71 miles of existing user-created trail, and construction of an additional 2.0 miles of non-motorized singletrack trail, creating a trail loop system, all on public land. This project will provide a sustainable and long-lasting recreation opportunity for the public, while discouraging use of adjacent private land and avoiding sensitive cultural and natural resources. Work was conducted by TTF trail crew, USFS personnel, and volunteers at no cost to the public.Lower Carpenter Valley was recently purchased by the Truckee Donner Land Trust and is currently open to the public with their docent led hikes. In August of 2019 TTF's crew broke ground on a new 3 mile trail that will circumnavigate this stunning meadow. This project will continue during the summer of 2020.

"In previous years, the Florida Breast Cancer Foundation has held free education conferences based in hotels with an average registration of approximately 100 persons. During 2015-16 the focus on education changed from conferences to one-on-one and small group contacts in communities that are medically underserved and/or have a higher level of late stage diagnosis of breast cancer than the average in the state of Florida. This resulted in the creation and funding of the CARES Project. During 2015-16, more than 8,000 women and men were contacted with many of them referred for breast cancer screenings. Also during 2015-16 the Foundation began discussions on another education program with outreach primarily to the African American communities. That program will begin in January 2017. The Florida Breast Cancer Foundation awards grants for Educaton and Research Programs statewide. The Florida Breast Cancer Foundation is working to better the lives of those facing breast cancer in the Florida community. Education awards grants have previously been awarded in support of innovative projects in the areas of breast health and breast cancer education, outreach, and support targeted services not otherwise available to the medically underserved populations of Florida. Education grants are awarded in support of innovative projects in four priority areas: Educate women in the areas where they need to become proactive advocates for their own breast health through education workshops; Provide education to breast cancer survivors, their families and advocates on life after or with cancer, including the """"transition phase"""" from active treatment to survivorship; Provide education on breast health to young women and men with a focus on Middle School, High School and College ages; and Create and provide a method of education, on late stage breast cancer diagnosis, that will help reduce the percentage of these diagnoses , in the areas that exceed the state of Florida average. Scientific Research grants are awarded to institutions in the state of Florida who submit proposals on innovative research projects that have the potential to make a significant impact on breast cancer. The grants must be in one of 5 areas of research: basic, clinical, and translational breast cancer research; epidemiological studies of breast cancer; research on possible links between breast cancer and the environment; psychoimmunological research; and innovative awards and idea grants. In 2015-16, 5 research grants of approximately $200,000 each were approved and funded with a grant project period of July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018. During 2015-16, an RFA was announced with 21 applications received. The Education Committee rcommended the funding of 11 grants. The recommendation was not considered by the Board until July, 2016. The mission of the Florida Breast Cancer Foundation is to end Breast Cancer through advocacy, education and research. Aside from research and education grants and the Education Conference, the work of the Foundation is accomplished not by holding events, but by working with resources throughout Florida. We attend health fairs and conferences providing breast health, breast cancer, and survivorship information to advocates, families, and those with breast cancer. We provide speakers at events and at educational opportunities. We respond to more than 300 contacts each year from those seeking information and/or direction on where to go, who to see, or what to do.

"EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EVENTS - IN 2012, WINDUSTRY PRODUCED AND STAFFED FOR THE SEVENTH YEAR IN A ROW, THE WIND ENERGY CENTER OF THE ECO EXPERIENCE AT THE MINNESOTA STATE FAIR. WITH THIS EVENT WINDUSTRY PRESENTED WIND ENERGY AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTION TO NEARLY 260,000 ECO EXPERIENCE VISITORS OVER THE 12 DAYS OF THE FAIR. THE EXECUTION OF THE EVENT INVOLVES SECURING CORPORATE SPONSORSHIP, RECRUITING, TRAINING, AND SCHEDULING VOLUNTEERS, UPDATING AND CURATING THE EXHIBITS, DESIGNING NEW MATERIALS AND VOLUNTEER T-SHIRTS, SET-UP AND TEAR-DOWN, HAVING A PAID STAFF PERSON ON SITE 13 HOURS A DAY FOR 12 DAYS. THIS YEAR, 72 WIND ENERGY CENTER VOLUNTEERS WORKED OVER 347 HOURS DURING THE COURSE OF THE FAIR. WE COLLECTED OVER 1,000 SIGNED POSTCARDS FROM FAIR-GOERS, DECLARING THEIR GENERAL SUPPORT FOR MORE WIND ENERGY IN MINNESOTA. THESE CARDS ARE DELIVERED TO STATE LAWMAKERS DURING THE 2013 LEGISLATIVE SESSION. IN DECEMBER 2012, WINDUSTRY HELD A WEBINAR TO EXAMINE AND LEARN FROM THE CASHTON GREENS PROJECT, A COMMUNITY WIND PROJECT IN WISCONSIN. THE WEBINAR, ATTENDED BY 74 PEOPLE, EXPLORED THE UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN TWO PRIVATE ENTERPRISES, GUNDERSEN HEALTH SYSTEM AND THE ORGANIC VALLEY FAMILY FARM COOPERATIVE. WE WERE PLEASED AND HONORED TO PARTNER WITH THE WIND POWERING AMERICA TEAM AT THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY (NREL) TO PRESENT THIS WEBINAR. LANDOWNER WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION RESOURCE CENTER - WINDUSTRY PROVIDES DIRECT SERVICES, SUCH AS SITE ASSESSMENTS, WIND RESOURCE ANALYSES, ECONOMIC MODELING, EQUIPMENT ASSESSMENT AND ADVISING BUSINESS SET-UP, TO THOSE SEEKING TO DEVELOP A COMMUNITY WIND PROJECT. IN 2012, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE USDA, WINDUSTRY'S LWEA RESOURCE CENTER CONTINUED TO ASSIST EMERGING RURAL WIND ENERGY ENTERPRISES IN THREE STATES (WISCONSIN, MONTANA AND WEST VIRGINIA) AND TO MOVE THESE LANDOWNER GROUPS FURTHER ALONG TOWARD THE GOAL OF COMMUNITY-OWNED WIND ENERGY. THROUGH THE LWEA, WE ALSO COORDINATED THE REGION NINE SMALL WIND BULK BUY PROGRAM IN MINNESOTA. WIND ENERGY ADVOCACY - WINDUSTRY WORKS ON THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LEVELS TO INFORM AND ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES THAT WILL STIMULATE WIND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER FORMS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY. ADVOCACY EFFORTS IN 2012 INCLUDED:WINDUSTRY WORKED WITH TWO WIND INDUSTRY GROUPS (AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION-AWEA AND DISTRIBUTED WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION-DWEA) ON FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO EXTEND THE FEDERAL PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT (PTC)/INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT (ITC). WINDUSTRY SERVES ON THE COMMUNITY WIND COMMITTEE OF AWEA, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY SOUGHT AN EXTENSION OF THE SECTION 48 PTC/ITC FOR LAND-BASED WIND POWER. THE ITC EXTENSION FOR LAND-BASED WIND POWER REPRESENTS A CRITICAL PIECE OF PUBLIC POLICY NECESSARY TO CONTINUE THE GROWTH OF DISTRIBUTED AND COMMUNITY WIND. ALSO, AS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF DWEA, WINDUSTRY SOUGHT AN EXPANSION OF THE EXISTING ITC FOR COMMUNITY WIND PROJECTS UNDER 20MW WHICH WOULD BE GOOD UNTIL 2016. IN THE END, THE FEDERAL PTC/ITC WAS EXTENDED IN JANUARY 2013 FOR ONE YEAR WITH THE ADDED TIME THAT IF A PROJECT BEGINS CONSTRUCTION IN 2013 IT CAN BE COMPLETED BY DECEMBER 2014.WINDUSTRY PARTICIPATED IN AND WAS INVITED TO SPEAK AND SUBMIT COMMENTS IN A RECENT DISTRIBUTED GENERATION (DG) FACILITATED STAKEHOLDER DIALOG LED BY THE MINNESOTA DIVISION OF ENERGY RESOURCES (DER). SEVERAL IMPORTANT FINDINGS CAME OUT OF THESE DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL SERVE TO MOVE THE DG PROCESS AND MINNESOTA'S NET METERING POLICY FORWARD. THIS WORK WILL HELP TO CREATE THE CULTURE OF SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT FOR DG IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE GREATLY INCREASED DG DEPLOYMENT IN THE STATES ENERGY SYSTEM OVER THE LONG TERM THAT THE ORIGINAL POLICY NEVER DID. PROGRAM SERVICE- COMMUNITY AND SMALL WIND RESOURCES. THROUGH OUR WEBSITE AND OTHER ELECTRONIC FORMATS, INCLUDING THE TELEPHONE, E-NEWSLETTER, AND SOCIAL MEDIA, WE HAVE DAILY INTERACTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THESE FORMATS IS CONSTANTLY MONITORED, UPDATED AND REFRESHED. ONE OF THE MOST UTILIZED TOOLS ON WINDUSTRY'S WEBSITE IS THE COMMUNITY WIND TOOLBOX. THIS UNPARALLELED RESOURCE INCLUDES 16 CHAPTERS OF ABUNDANT, PRACTICAL INFORMATION FOR FARMERS AND RURAL LANDOWNERS LOOKING TO DEVELOP COMMERCIAL-SCALE WIND PROJECTS, WITH SECTIONS DEVOTED TO PROJECT PLANNING, SITTING, PERMITTING, COST, TURBINE SELECTION, PUBLIC POLICY, AND OTHER KEY SUBJECTS. IN 2012, WE ALSO DEVELOPED NEW COMMUNITY AND SMALL WIND RESOURCES AND REBUILT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR WEBSITE TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR RESOURCES: WE RESEARCHED AND DRAFTED CASE STUDIES OF COMMUNITY WIND PROJECTS NATIONWIDE. THIS WORK INVOLVED CONDUCTING IN-PERSON AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS AND ONLINE RESEARCH, DOCUMENTING THE PROJECTS, AND DESIGNING A UNIFORM PRESENTATION FORMAT THAT IS INVITING AND ACCESSIBLE. TEN CASE STUDIES WERE COMPLETED. THESE CASE STUDIES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE ON BOTH THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION'S AND WINDUSTRY'S WEBSITES. DOCUMENTING THE SUCCESS STORIES OF EXISTING COMMUNITY WIND ENERGY PROJECTS AND MAKING THEM AVAILABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST LEVEL OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WE ALSO LAUNCHED A PROJECT TO DEVELOP OF A SET OF REPLICABLE, STREAMLINED, INNOVATIVE MULTI-OWNER BUSINESS MODELS. THESE MODELS ARE BASED ON REAL-WORLD WIND PROJECTS DESIGNED FOR USE BY MUNICIPALITIES, LANDOWNERS, LOCAL UTILITY COMPANIES, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AS THEY SEEK TO ESTABLISH COMMUNITY WIND PROJECTS. BECAUSE SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MODELS CAN ONLY EXIST WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF SUPPORTIVE PUBLIC POLICY, THIS ONGOING INITIATIVE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDELINES ON CREATING A POLICY ENVIRONMENT FAVORABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY WIND ENERGY PROJECTS.THE CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (CMS) UPON WHICH THE WINDUSTRY WEBSITE WAS BUILT WAS WOEFULLY OUT OF DATE.

"Patient Registry: In 2007, the Fibromuscular Dysplasia Society of America (FMDSA) began a data registry with the goal of increasing understanding of FMD. The goals of this registry are to identify patient characteristics associated with FMD, potential markers of the disease, and commonly used imaging and treatment modalities. Michigan Clinical Outcomes Research and Reporting Program is the coordinating center for the registry. The first patient was entered in 2009. Over the last year, enrollment in the registry increased from 2675 patients to 3018 patients at the end of 2020. We currently have 17 registry centers constituting the largest FMD registry. Seattle Childrens Hospital and the University of Colorado joined the registry in 2020. Our goal is to continue enrolling patients and adding additional centers. The registry data helped us to learn more about FMD, how to treat the disease and has driven research hopefully leading to a cure. Patient Support:As we spread awareness, and see a drastic increase in diagnosed patients, patient support becomes a larger part of our responsibility. Due to the demand, we have continued to grow the Volunteer Support Network. These volunteers have been identified in the US and internationally. Many groups have evolved to the point of holding local meetings. We also offer support through social media platforms including Inspire, Instagram and Facebook where we have thousands of patients participating. We are also active on Twitter allowing patients, clinicians and physicians to communicate. We continue to add FMD materials and videos to our website and patient toolbox. We offer FMD materials in Spanish and Japanese and work with our international colleagues who offer materials in several other languages. Finally, we continue to participate in patient meetings throughout the US and internationally, offering guidanace and resources to patients. Public Awareness Program:This program was initiated in July 2005 as a Grass Roots Awareness Program. We help patients educate their family, friends and healthcare providers about FMD with material provided by FMDSA. We have many valuable resources on our website to help communicate FMD in laymens terms, including a Public Service Announcement, as well as more in depth information for physicians that can help bridge the gap and build a better relationship between patient and physician. The Public Awareness Program also includes educational work with media outlets, other organizations, journals, speaking engagements and articles. We also offer live Zoom meetings. There is rarely a day that goes by that we are contacted by a newly diagnosed patient. We have seen the diagnosis rate grow in direct proportion to our programs. See additional info on Schedule O Healthcare Professional Education Program:This program combines attending medical conferences and presenting within hospital environments and is a major focus of FMDSA and has been an avenue to educate thousands of medical professionals. The result is a greater awareness of FMD within the medical community, improved medical expertise for patients, and development of critical partnerships that are helping us spur more research activity. In addition to our Physician page, we have also maintained a research Network Page on the website containing all the information published from the patient registry and other researchers studying FMD. There are also PowerPoint presentations and videos available for health care providers. We have seen a direct correlation between our awareness and educational programs to the increase in patients getting diagnosed. Unfortuntely, in 2020, our 13th annual meeting was postponed due to COVID.

As a bridging program, it opens more training options and uncovers additional employment opportunities, together with training to operate various home-based businesses. Costs for the Residential Programs were mostly provided by donations through Homes of Hope, Inc.[1b] In 2015: 40 mothers (aged 14 to 27) and children found a home at the Homes of Hope campus and received safe, secure accommodation and training. Other important numbers include: 6 healthy babies born while their mothers were in the care of HoH; 9 women completed the residential program and were reintegrated into a safe community with continued support from HoH; and 21 infants and toddlers participated in early childhood education at the campus school. Additionally, 35 victims were withdrawn to attend our training programs as Day Scholars. [2] Community-Based Programs: CBT was active in strategic villages in Fiji and in the Solomon Islands. They trained community leaders to recognize indicators of sexual exploitation and to take action to break the culture of silence towards violence against women. They continued recruiting and training """"gatekeepers"""" to take action to prevent and protect the victims of sexual trafficking and vulnerable individuals in each community. Costs for the Community-Based Programs were met largely by various grants and also by donations through Homes of Hope, Inc.[3] Duplication/Networking: Homes of Hope Fiji has increased its impact by sharing research, procedures, and curriculum with similarly tasked organizations and government agencies. They continue to chair a Fijian government subcommittee on Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children (CSEC).

Through our Shelter Aid Program we provide support to various migrant shelters in Tijuana Baja California and Mexico. We provide funding to help cover the cost overrent utilities shelter construction projects and food for shelter residents. This support has become more crucial to migrant survival and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Shelter Aid Program assists over 900 migrants daily supporting 15 different migrant shelters in Tijuana. Groups of vounteers leave bottles of water in the desert to prevent death by thirst of border crossers. Border Angels has left thousands of gallons of water in the desert along paths most commonly traveled by migrants.

"LEJ serves the Bayview-Hunters Point community in Southeast San Francisco.San Francisco is a tale of two cities. On the citys western side, residents enjoy a wealth of parks such as Crissy Field and the new $118 million Presidio Tunnel Tops Park; healthy food options from large grocery stores to boutique markets to countless restaurants; and the peace of mind and freedom that comes with living in a safe, low-crime neighborhood.Across the city in the southeast, lies a different San FranciscoBayview-Hunters Point. For decades, this historically African American community has served as the dumping ground for San Franciscos dirty utilities, heavy industry, and toxic pollution. This three-square-mile industrial neighborhood is bordered by two freeways and home to 700 hazardous waste sites, 325 underground petroleum storage tanks, two Superfund sites, and decades of illegal dumping (SF Department of Public Health -SFDPH).It is also home to 34,000+ residents, 26% of whom are under the age of 18the highest percentage of children of any San Francisco neighborhood (SFDPH). According to CalEnviroScreen, 80% of Bayview-Hunters Point residents are people of color with 33% identifying as African American (the citys largest concentration of African Americans), 34% as Latinx, and 25% as Asian American. Approximately 40% of families in Bayview-Hunters Point are severely low-income, living twice below the federal poverty levela cycle of poverty that will continue without education and workforce development opportunities. Unlike families on the western side of the city, a healthy stroll around the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood is not an option. In addition to air pollution from heavy industry and the neighboring freeways, more than half of Bayview residents report feeling unsafe in their community. Bayview-Hunters Point has double the violent crime rate of San Francisco as a whole (SFDPH).According to the SFDPHs Bayview-Hunters Point Community Resiliency report, Bayview-Hunters Point received Low to Very Low rankings for residents access to healthy food. In addition, that same report noted that unlike other parts of San Francisco, healthy, green parklands and trees are scarce in this heavily industrialized neighborhood.LEJ serves over 1,000 SFUSD youth each year and works closely with community organizations to engage youth and young adult audiences in our environmental education and workforce development programs.

"Brooklyn Montessori Ltd is a school that recognizes and values the importance of staff and teacher professional development. The professional development theme for the year was positive communication with children and adults. Each teacher was given two books to read throughout the school year. The Power of Our Words by Paula Denton and Choice Words by Peter H. Johnston were used throughout the school year in study groups and whole staff gatherings to review the chapters and concepts presented in the text. Teachers were invited to visit other schools to see examples of positive communication. The MDS PTA purchased a cooking cart that housed equipment that could be used in food preparations and cooking projects with children. Cookbooks and programs were purchased to support teachers' cooking units. Elizabeth Solomon, alumni parent and expert on childhood nutrition, presented a workshop to teachers on healthy choices for young children. We drafted a nutrition policy for the school to follow as a result of working with Elizabeth and acquiring the tools needed to increase food preparation and cooking in our curriculum and programming. With the hiring of a Montessori trained and experienced Executive Director, teachers received additional guidance on classroom environment and curriculum planning and implementation. Each classroom improved as additional Montessori equipment and literacy materials were purchased and placed out in the classroom for children to explore and learn. Teachers worked together to improve their record keeping and progress reporting practices. A standardized plan and set of forms were adopted across the school community. Goal setting forms were used to create a collaborative platform for parents and teachers to work together to support each child's individual needs and learning style. The adults revisited the goals set at the previous conference. This focused attention on action plans and allowed for reflection and feedback. This uniformed system increased the level of professionalism in communicating with parents about their child's progress and learning needs. An added parent-teacher conference improved adult relationships and created an additional opportunity for parents to discuss developmental concerns with their child's teachers in a timely manner. Brooklyn Montessori Ltd is also committed to supporting the needs of parents. The School's PTA sponsored several well-attended workshops on a variety of topics. The Executive Director explained the sequence of materials and lessons in Montessori Math. One teacher presented a parent education workshop entitled """"Montessori At Home."""" The presentation presented a variety of ways that parents could involve their children in activities at home, including ways to support their children's independence, abilities to make choices and take on responsibility. Teachers also shared some of the common language that they use while communicating with children around positive discipline strategies so parents could understand how to apply this language at home. Parents also benefited from a workshop given by Joyce Szuflita, owner of NYC School Help, LLC and expert on navigating the NYC school system. She presented an informative workshop on how to choose a school that is a good match for their child and family; from application to acceptance. Parents were able to build their relationships with her through her blog, newsletter, website and individualized counseling sessions.",0,"The summary focuses on educational activities, professional development, and parental support without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"International Public Health/International Health: Access Initiative: Free the Vaccine for COVID-19 Campaign: For this second COVID year, in partnership with the Center for Artistic Activism, our creative campaign has attracted a diverse group of people in over 30 countries aged 17 to 72. During COVID-19 we have increased our active base of supporters by 700% through building community via our online advocacy labs for Free the Vaccine for COVID-19. Medical students work alongside experienced artists and others to experiment with innovative actions, learning through iteration and reflecting on what worked and what didn't. Many of these participants are starting from zero and ending with deep knowledge of the biomedical research and development process and confidence in their ability to use creativity and culture to improve it. The Advocacy Innovation Labs represent unique leadership training through collaborative, experimental, non-hierarchical, global actions. Through this kind of organizing we have a mechanism for building and strengthening community power. May 5th, 2021 was an historic day not just for our Free The Vaccine for COVID-19 campaign but for our entire movement. At the end of our rally for 'vaccine access for everyone, everywhere' on the National Mall; we were informed that the U.S. government would indeed support negotiations on the TRIPS Waiver. As we work to shift the global research and development model to be more people-centered and needs-driven rather than focused on benefiting shareholders this was an important step in that direction. Further action however must be taken if it is to save lives and increase global access to COVID-19 medicines.On October 28th 2021 UAEM students and staff supported the organizing for a protest led by allies Peoples Action in Washington DC to call on world leaders at G20 1) lift vaccine patents and share the technology to allow ALL countries to develop their own vaccines and 2) equitably redistribute surplus vaccines in high income nations. The rally was covered on the front page of Democracy Now. The image that was selected was of our Free the Vaccine banner with Sharing is Caring held up by students in Care Bear costumes. Covid-19 Public Funds Mapping Tool:On April 15th 2021, UAEM launched the second iteration of the COVID-19 Mapping Tool, a powerful and dynamic instrument demonstrating the depths and reach of taxpayer funds in the development of coronavirus-related medical technologies and vaccines. The new data on the updated website visualizes and articulates how public funds are being directed and spent for COVID-19 research into vaccines, treatments and diagnostics. The first iteration of the mapping tool was released in May 2020 in immediate response to the rapid injection of public money all over the world to accelerate the COVID-19 response. The update includes new data, additional countries, methodological refinements, and website features. UAEMs analysis boldly emphasizes the crucial role of public funds provided to public research institutions to innovate health technologies against COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized the value of our Mapping tool and added it to the WHO's Databases on inputs to R&D. UAEMs global team has been working on this initiative over the past 15 months as part of our campaign to ensure publicly-funded COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines are accessible and affordable to all. The White Paper to accompany the report can be found on the homepage of the website: https://www.publicmeds4covid.org/Our campaign at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to Take Back Xtandi, a publicly-funded prostate cancer drug developed on the campus continued to make very promising advances. In 2018, UAEM began organizing with students, medical residents, and researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to improve access to enzalutamide, brand name Xtandi, a publicly-funded prostate cancer drug developed on the campus and then being sold at over $120,000 per patient per year in the United States and priced out of reach in India. The goals were to urge the university leadership to: 1) drop the universitys patent claim in India on the drug and 2) introduce a new University of California (UC) wide licensing agreement that would improve access to medicines developed on the campus. During 2019 and early 2020 a few members of our UAEM community were followed by a documentary team from Participant Media, and portions of this campaign are covered in the new documentary White Coat Rebels that finally premiered. The documentary examines the pharmaceutical industry from the perspective of advocacy and those who are fighting against its power and influence. The Xtandi campaign led to discussions with UCLAs office of Science and Technology, and after sustained organizing and advocacy resulted in a commitment to advance access and licensing policies. The impact of the introduction of a new policy on access to and affordability of new medicines developed on University of California (UC) campuses would be very significant given the huge amount of biomedical innovation driven by the UC system.. UAEM is also urging UCLA to announce the policy publicly as soon as possible.. UAEM students are now organizing across campuses to urge their institutions to introduce similar in order to secure the policy for multiple universities which would set a new precedent for the UC system. Medical Specialties Research: Innovation Initiative: In April 2021, we launched the latest version of the University Report Card, a critical study of the top sixty research universities in the US scrutinizing their biomedical research and development (R&D) policies, practices, and performance in domestic and neglected global public health needs in access to medicines, including their COVID-19 response. Universities were graded in the following categories: Access, Innovation, Empowerment, and new this year Transparency and COVID-19. The new COVID-19 section focused on global access licensing policies related to COVID-19 including confirming which universities had signed the Open COVID Pledge or supported the COVID Technology Access Pool (C-TAP). The answer, more than one year into the pandemic and over a year of campaigning has remained at zero universities signing onto these essential WHO mechanisms. This is further evidence of universities' for-profit approach to technology transfer and why the work of UAEM is critical to disrupting the existing model which serves as a barrier to access to medicines. As of publishing, of the sixty research universities, only two institutions have received the highest grade). A stark contrast to the majority of failing grades, even with a generous grading curve. Below are some of the key findings from the report: Fifteen percent of universities devoted no research funding to global health research; most devote 1-5%. Fifteen percent of schools devoted no medical research funding to neglected diseases; most devote 0.51-1.0%. Between 11% and 30% of university biomedical research is published in open-access journals. NO universities reported having policies that require researchers publish all the results of their clinical trials. Half of the universities have made no commitments to equitable COVID-19 biomedical licensing practices.With the release of the new Report Card our chapters will have updated tools at their disposal for further 2022 advocacy. The ranking and breakdown of their scores are available on the Report Card website: https://globalhealthgrades.org/Further, building on the successful launch of the first iteration of the report Clinical Trials Transparency and the role of US Universities, our follow-up report was launched in May 2021 and highlights the significant improvements in university reporting rates, largely due to advocacy by UAEM and our allies, while also reminding researchers and the larger public why this issue is important, using the COVID-19 pandemic as one example case. The timely disclosure of results helps to improve public health outcomes over time by reducing waste in research, increasing efficiency in the use of resources, limiting reporting bias and contributing to enhanced decision-making. Clinical trial transparency is critical for physicians to make informed decisions when prescribing medicines and for researchers to avoid duplicating studies.Successes highlighted in the report include: the increase in number of research institutions legally compliant under FDAAA (100% of clinical trials reported) from 13 to 17, the increase in total number of registered clinical trials from 446 to 1516 between February 2019 and February 2021, The decrease in total number of unreported trials from 138 to 101. The findings of the report and microsite www.altreroute.com/clinicaltrials were covered in STAT NEWS among other news outlets.In 2021 UAEM also partnered with the New York University (NYU) Technology Law and Policy (TLP) Clinic to file Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) regarding clinical trial enforcement. For the first time ever, the FDA issued a warning to Acceleron Pharma, Inc., a developer of experimental kidney cancer treatment. FDAs Notice of Noncompliance is the first time any more meaningful enforcement action has been taken by either FDA or NIH. The company was notified after failing to submit their Phase 2 drug trials from last year. In our ongoing investigation as part of our strategy to increase university compliance with FDAAA we have gathered evidence that over an eight-year period the FDA only sent a few dozen pre-notice letters to non-compliant sponsors suggesting they come into compliance. Going forward this advocacy work will continue at the chapter and national levels as part of our ongoing campaign to push universities to achieve 100% compliance in clinical trials transparency and become leaders in pushing for a more open and transparent biomedical R&D system. International Public Health/International Health: Empowerment Initiative. The UAEM North America Annual Conference was held virtually on October 2021 under the theme Student Response to Racial Inequity in Access to COVID-19 Medicines. The conference was organized and hosted by UAEM Chapters at Washington DC, Maryland and Virginia (DMV) Universities in Washington DC. Over 100 students, allies, professors and experts in global health from around the world attend the virtual conference. As in the previous years, the conference continued to focus on student-driven campaigns, skills-building training and organizing for action in the Covid-19 climate, while retaining expert-level panels and speakers. This year we had a powerful keynote panel infused with joy and fun filled learning. The panelists included Ruqaiijah Yearby, Professor of Law and Member of Center for Health Law Studies, Fatima Hassan, Founder & Director of Health Justice Initiative and Priti Krishtel, Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director of I-MAK. The conference also provided student-driven panels focusing on activities for both new and veteran UAEMers, with an emphasis on skills-training specific to our ongoing Free the Vaccine for Covid-19 campaign, our initiatives on alternative R&D, and UAEMs University Report Card project, and breakout sessions on how to use UAEM Mapping tools, Social Media as an Advocacy Tool, and Fake Pharma vs The People led by Peter Maybarduk, Public Citizen and one on Access to Insulin - #100YearsOn led by Molly Lepeska, Health Action International/ACCISS Study. Our goal was for students to leave the conference not only with increased knowledge and inspiration but with tangible and actionable skills to take back to their campuses and put into practice through targeted campus activities and beyond. UAEM also continued to collaborate with our expanding network in Europe, Brazil, Colombia and other areas, and continued to provide global health leadership opportunities and experience through campus initiatives and service on UAEMs Coordinating Committee, Board of Directors, Global Governance Council and other positions to ensure global UAEM cooperation, collaboration and representation.",0,"The summary focuses on public health initiatives, vaccine access, and advocacy without any mention of religious or faith-based concepts."

"Access to Essential Services, Housing and Education:Mano en Mano's long-standing programs in 2023 continued to meet the needs of immigrant and farmworker communities in Maine. Highlights include: responding to 6,162 requests for assistance for basic needs and referrals; welcoming and celebrating migrant workers; opening a food pantry visited by 5,802 individuals during the year; disbursing award monies to community members from the housing barrier relief fund for down payment and renovations; running bilingual childcare and nearly completing construction on a new childcare facility; and providing services to 363 migrant children/youth across Maine. Access and Advocacy:Access to essential services and advocacy address the lack of effective services available to immigrants and farmworkers in Maine that prevent these communities from meeting basic needs or pursuing long-term goals. Accomplishments include: answering 12,585 requests for assistance and referrals, welcoming 4,242 migrant and seasonal workers during the wreaths and wild blueberry seasons, distributing hard-to-access culturally relevant food to community members, and conducting 95% of community member encounters in a language other than English. Housing:We provided six units of affordable housing for farmworkers at Hand in Hand apartments in 2023, housing a total of 23 individuals. We awarded 7 grants from the Housing Barrier Removal Fund to community members for downpayment or repair assistance for them to become or remain homeowners and support wealth accumulation. Lastly, Welcome Home Downeast, LLC, a subsidiary corporation, continued work to build and renovate 8 units of housing in the area to allow more families to move to Washington county in the future. Rayitos de Sol Bilingual Childcare:In 2023 Mano en Mano's Rayitos de Sol Bilingual Childcare operated with the core mission of providing bilingual Spanish and English childcare that centers the languages and cultlures of the students we serve. The childcare served 21 families (24 children enrolled) during the year, with 50% of families receiving subsidies and support through the DHHS Childcare Subsidy program. The childcare provided stable long-term employment for staff, who earned $5.75-$8.75 more per hour than the average Maine childcare employee. Lastly, in 2023 Mano en Mano completed the bulk of construction on a new facility to house the Rayitos de Sol Childcare, which is anticipated to open in 2024. Migrant Education Program:Mano en Mano partners with the Maine Department of Education to administer the Maine Migrant Education Program (MEP). Through this program Mano en Mano provides educational support services to migrant children and youth, from birth through age 21, across Maine. MEP programming aims to help migrant children and youth achieve their educational goals, with a focus on educational transition support, seasonal instructional support, and advocacy support within school and education systems.

EVERY TUTOR COMPLETES A THOROUGH SCREENING AND TRAINING PROCESS, PARTICIPATING IN FIVE HOURS OF LITERACY TRAINING BEFORE THEY BEGIN WORKING WITH THEIR ELEMENTARY READER. THE CLOSE BOND THAT FORMS BETWEEN THE TEENS AND THEIR YOUNG READER LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE PROGRAMS SUCCESS. PRINCIPALS REPORT THAT STUDENTS RUN TO TEAM READ AFTER SCHOOL FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEND TIME WITH A COOL TEENAGER. THE GOAL OF EVERY TUTOR IS TO HELP THEIR STUDENT IMPROVE THEIR READING SKILLS SO THEY ARE READING AT GRADE LEVEL BY THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. IN THE SUMMER OF 2014, TEAM READ PARTNERED WITH SEATTLE PUBLIC LIBRARY (SPL) TO PROVIDE A SUMMER READING PROGRAM IN THE SUMMER AT 4 LIBRARY BRANCHES. RESEARCH HAS DOCUMENTED THE READING LOSS THAT LOW-INCOME STUDENTS EXPERIENCE OVER THE SUMMER AND TEAM READ IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH SPL TO PROVIDE SUMMER READING SUPPORT FOR THE 2ND AND 3RD GRADE STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST SUPPORT AND SUMMER JOBS FOR TEENS.

IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON ELEMENTARY STUDENTS AND TEENS: READING IS THE FOUNDATION FOR ALL LEARNING AND RESEARCH SUPPORTS THAT IT IS CRITICAL FOR STUDENTS TO BE READING AT GRADE LEVEL BY THE END OF THE 3RD GRADE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ACADEMIC SUCCESS. DURING THE 2013-2014 SCHOOL YEAR, TEAM READ PROVIDED 368 2ND AND 3RD GRADERS WITH ONE-ON-ONE AFTER SCHOOL LITERACY SUPPORT AND PROVIDED MEANINGFUL WORK AND VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE FOR 412 TEENS. TEAM READS RESEARCH-BASED, RESULTS-DRIVEN MODEL ADDRESSES A PROFOUND NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE EXTENDED DAY LITERACY INTERVENTION FOR STRUGGLING READERS. BY PROVIDING CHILDREN WHO ARE READING A YEAR OR MORE BELOW GRADE LEVEL WITH ONE-ON-ONE READING TUTORING BY A HIGHLY TRAINED, DEDICATED TEEN TUTOR, THESE STUDENTS BUILD KEY READING SKILLS. IN THE 2013-14 PROGRAM YEAR EVALUATION RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT PRIOR TO TEAM READ, 72% OF STUDENTS ONLY GAINED AN AVERAGE OF 6 MONTHS OF SKILLS THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AFTER A YEAR IN OUR PROGRAM, THOSE SAME STUDENTS GAINED AN AVERAGE OF ONE YEAR AND TWO MONTHS OF SKILLS - SOME GAINED OVER THREE YEARS' WORTH OF SKILLS. ADDITIONALLY, YOUNG READERS ARE TYPICALLY EXPECTED TO GAIN TWO TO FOUR TEACHER'S COLLEGE LEVELS PER YEAR, AND TEAM READ PARTICIPANTS GAINED FOUR TO FIVE LEVELS OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR.
